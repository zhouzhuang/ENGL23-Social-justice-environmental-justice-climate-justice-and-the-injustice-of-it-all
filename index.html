I really appreciated that you brought up the concept of "Degrowth." A huge sect of the environmental and climate justice movement dances around this idea because of the ideological weight behind it. Just like the Green New Deal encapsulates, many environmentalists seem to think that we can address these crises without challenging the foundational principles of our economic model. They are convinced that we can solve the climate crisis and eliminate social injustice while continuing to grow economically...which is just a profoundly stupid notion. Many of these proponents even recognize that the profit-driven, capitalist system is the cause of so many of our ailments, yet think that we can work from within that system to fix everything. It's like we're trying to heal a wounded soldier by suturing his bullet wounds without first removing the bullets. Sure, we can cover up the holes, but all we're doing is shielding our vision from the things that are killing us. To really solve these crises, we have to address the root causes of social and environmental degradation, which are petrocapitalism, hyperconsumerism, anthropocentrism, structural racism, the remnant legacies of colonialism, materialism, etc. All of these "isms" are rooted in the much larger "ism" that is running our society and the planet into oblivion - capitalism. Infinite growth is not possible. We've far surpassed the sustainable limits of growth. It is time for degrowth. This concept seems scary to the average American because it has a negative connotation of regression. However, I think this is a total misunderstanding of what degrowth can look like. I believe by deprioritizing economic growth and progress, we can focus on human growth and progress; we can shift from increasing profits to increasing happiness, from expanding wealth to expanding relationships, from working long hours to spending long hours with our loved ones, and from saving life for after retirement to living right now, in the present.

<br><br>
The degrowth initiative will be the only sensible solution for advanced, wealthy nations like the United States. However, it does not necessarily apply on a global scale. Developing nations, mainly in the Global South, have not yet been able to achieve even a fraction of the level of development that advanced nations have. This is not due to their lack of progress, laziness, inferiority, or any problematic associations with race. This is because of a long history of imperialism and exploitation that has left these peoples in disadvantaged positions ever since. These populations must be allowed to achieve some development before we can expect them to worry about the climate crisis, at least to the same extent as developed nations. In order to buffer the climate impacts these countries will produce from development and growth, us advanced nations must drastically reduce our climate impact and growth. That is why it is imperative for the United States and other advanced nations to implore degrowth.

I completely agree with you degrowth is absolutely necessary for sustainable living. Capitalism has run the world for so long, and it has brought us to this issue, so clearly a new system must be implemented. I believe the Green New Deal is a great step in the right direction, but I fear people won't easily give up the mindset of continuous and increasing growth. Green New Deal emphasizes reductions in many aspects of our life, which is something Americans don't typically like to do. The "American Dream" is being able to afford anything and everything you want, something completely contradictory to the Green New Deal.

I completely agree that Americans will not want to give up their lifestyles to implement the Green New Deal which, is one of the reasons some push back against it. I think people are also scared of the changes that the bill would make to the economy since it would target fossil fuel companies and could put at risk many jobs.


<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you. As the Green New Deal indicates, climate change that’s mostly caused by developed countries have exacerbated systemic racial, regional, social, environmental, and economic injustices. In another word, the huge amount of greenhouse gases emitted by the U.S. because of its capitalism unjustly affect deindustrialized, depopulated, and rural countries such as Bangladesh. The fact is that U.S. is too developed, exploiting too much natural resources, while developing countries like Bangladesh is so undeveloped and encounters destroyed environment. I am really shocked by Ken’s statistics: U.S. consume 6600 percent more meat per capita, fly 14000 percent more per capita, and own 21000 percent more cars per capita than Bangladesh. Also, Ken’s explanation about the social justice, environment justice, and climate justice are clear. In Bangladesh, people are forced to work under horrific conditions, suffered from point source pollution, and impacted greatly by the flood and other unusual weather patterns. I really think that capitalists in developed world should consider how many innocent lives they influence or even kill because of their profit goals. Under such condition, the developed world should enter a period of de-growth and fundamentally change the culture of capitalism. Moreover, U.S. and other countries should have new policies regarding helping the developing countries that are suffered all kinds of injustice. For example, U.S. can provide more funding to Bangladesh to build environmental-friendly factories and improve working conditions, which would promote the economic development here while also building better relationship of cooperation. Therefore, cultural change and policy change are necessary and significant to mitigate the climate crisis and reduce systemic injustices.

Hi Randy, I completely agree with what you have said here. I think it is important that we remind ourselves that the United States, in addition to many other wealthy imperialist countries, have put many of these poorer countries in the current position they are in. I really appreciate how you acknowledge the history of American imperialism in said countries. Like you said, they didn’t just choose to be in this position, America created a system where poorer countries would stay poor and ultimately dependent on America and other wealthy countries. This hegemonic relationship isn’t just a coincidence, we created it. Since we, and by we I mean America, have created this position the world is in, I believe we have a great duty to help the mess we created. I truly am not sure how this should be done, and I believe this is an important question to ask these questions to the countries we have exploited and put in this position. Ask them what is the best way to support them. We often look at these problems from the outside in and it is vital that we give those experiencing the effects of the mess we created a voice of how they want things done. 
<br><br>
This can only be done if those in power have completely PURE intentions of our upcoming interactions with the countries who need the most help. Considering the history of American intervention in foreign countries, I truly don’t know if this is possible. The Green New Deal seems to be a step in the right way. However, more needs to be done and fast.




<br><hr>
I agree with Randy in that it is our responsibility as a nation to accept the fact that “degrowth” is the answer and that capitalism is the root of our problem. Our nation is stuck in the mindset of eternal growth, but we need to take a step back and realize the detrimental impacts of the structure of our capitalist society. As of now, our nation revolves around everything excessive. From our capitalist structure to consumerism, Americans strive to live a life of extravagance, but in reality, this “American dream” is a path to the degradation of our earth. We must change our ways by taking a path towards degrowth. Rather than being a hyper consumer, capitalist, materialistic society, we should start cutting back and being mindful. On the other hand, we must help developing countries with a path towards growth. This gives them a chance to escape the marginalizing imperialism and step towards a new path of sustainable growth.
<br><br>

The key to this solution is balance. By taking the responsibility of necessary degrowth as well as helping developing nations grow, there is a balance of the globe’s carbon footprint. This balance and evening out of carbon production allow the world to develop and grow in a sustainable and beneficial way for everybody.



<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you that any more growth for our nation is completely unsustainable. The question remains though, how do we actually implement this concept of de-growth? As you said, many Americans would not be on board with this idea. Our nation’s main focus is consumerism and I honestly don’t know how changing this is possible, seeing as how the corporations that contribute to this rampant buying and selling are in some ways even more powerful than our government. I think right now our best bet is through voting and through not supporting corporations, like fast fashion companies, that have a negative impact on less developed nations. 
<br><br>

We as a nation really need to take ownership for the detriment we have caused our planet. We cannot keep letting poorer countries suffer from the climate crisis while we benefit economically. Our country has been incredibly selfish in the midst of the climate crisis and if companies aren’t going to own up to that, then we as citizens must. It’s immoral to turn a blind eye to the pain this situation is causing people to suffer through in countries like Bangladesh, while we get to enjoy the conveniences of living our lavish lifestyles.



<br><hr>
I agree with everything you said. Your comment is very put together and WOKE and I couldn't have said it better. These structures are put in place to keep the rich, old, white men on top and the rest on the bottom. So, yes de-growth and deconstruction is something that we, as a society, need to take up. These systems may have worked and benefited for the 1% but the 1% cannot keep living the way they do and expect that to be the norm for them and for everyone else. We cannot keep the same systems and expect social, environment, or climate injustice to wither away. As long as infinite growth is in place, no one can really grow at all. My comment on the films were much more optimistic but understanding that we have to get the rest of America to see that we cannot support the way we live any longer, is making me turn back to my pessimistic self. I fear that no one will truly get it until they see the effects of it, but what's funny is that WE ALREADY ARE. Not only does this system not work for people in Bangladesh, it doesn't work for people in our country as well, as much as we would like to believe it does.



<br><hr>
I agree with what you said about the explanation of “degrowth” which i also feel curious about. People nowadays can’t always figure out how climate would influence his or her home, country, and the world because the climate problem has been shut out by the “flourishing economy,” but it grows in an unhealthy way which will cause degrowth of our society. However, in order to solve those severe problem, it can’t be fixed by only curing the surface just like you said. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the main reasons of those problems. I really like what you said at the end of the first paragraph. Being happiness is much more important that focusing on profit. Also, giving other poor countries opportunity to grow is also important, so other wealthier countries should be the samples to pay more attention on environmental problem to give poor countries more spaces to develop their economy.



<br><hr>
I really appreciate this comment. For a while I’ve found the prevalent narrative surrounding the climate crisis to be, perhaps naive and overly complacent. Oftentimes, further technological developments are lauded as the solution for climate change — electric vehicles, carbon capture — and don’t get me wrong, I do think innovations for the purpose of helping preserve the environment are important. But I find it ironic that these advancements are supposed to be the solution to the biggest crisis of our generation since it’s these same technological and economic developments that so many Americans now take for granted that started us down this path. Is it realistic to expect the root cause of a problem to also be its solution? 

<br><br>

Which brings me to the concept of “degrowth” and the social conventions that now permeate our society surrounding capitalism, consumerism, materialism, and yes, though perhaps difficult to acknowledge at times, the still lingering consequences of centuries of colonialism. Once again, I have to state that while the term anthropocene is often used to denote climate change caused by mankind, I think that the term “capitalocene” is more apt to describe how its the prioritization of economic growth and development that really kickstarted the climate crisis during the Great Acceleration/1960s.  

<br><br>

Furthermore, I think that large scale social reform is going to be an inevitable part of seriously addressing the climate crisis, but I also agree with you that social reform will have to happen regardless of the climate crisis at some part or another. As you said, infinite growth is not possible and we’ve definitely surpassed the boundaries of sustainable growth which only leaves us with one option: “degrowth”. And perhaps this falls in line with the decision to live by the concept of minimalism on an individual level. Yet, with how deeply ingrained these toxic values and “isms” have rooted themselves in American culture and quite frankly, the rest of the developed world, one can only wonder exactly what it will take to cause such seemingly unlikely social reconstruction.



<br><hr>
I want to say the exact same thing about degrowth. It is impossible for a country’s economic growth to remain the same level as it currently is or was before if its people has adapted a sustainable lifestyle. Imagine people switching to plant-based diet and taking public transportation or zero-emission vehicles, the diversity of goods and services will just be largely reduced. The demand of different products is reduced and so is supply. This will certainly cut down the economic growth. Therefore, I really agree with you that those who insist that we are able to prevent climate and social injustices without negatively affecting the economy are definitely stupid. However, I have a slightly different idea with your opinion that the degrowth initiative will be the only sensible solution for advanced and wealthy countries like the United States. I don’t really think that developed countries, especially United States would give up, or in someway not lower the priority of developing its economy. With a president like Trump, environmental justice will simply be ignored and postponed. While this is true, there are still things countries can do without hurting the economy much. For example, I come from Shanghai, China, and as far as I know the environmental policies and infrastructures are not very common and mature at all in my country, but since winter 2019, Shanghai has established extremely strict regulations of domestic waste management. Every household, business, and community is required by the law to sort out their everyday waste into four categories: dry garbage, wet garbage (kitchen waste), recyclables and hazardous waste. Those who do not obey will be fined. I am personally very glad to see that my country is finally paying attention and actually taking actions to address the environmental issues. It made me realize that even developed countries like mine can make basic changes like this as a first step, calling on more individuals to concern and care about this issue, even though many other countries in the world have already done such things long ago. It still made me proud.

Speaking of the wide gap between the rags and the riches, I can’t help but recall one of my favorite TV shows Altered Carbon. The show was set in the distant future, in which the rich are living in the top of the clouds while the poors had to live on the ground and didn’t have many choices towards where they live and what they do. We thought such a wide social gap would only occur in the future, but if we put the issue on an international scale, it is already happening. Rich people living on the top of skyscrapers ordering factories or trash dumpster fields to be built in poor countries while people there had no choice but to work there. This cycle is rigged. Society is rigged. Some people were born to different doors they can open up to, but some others were born to a windowless cells where they have barely minimal chances to experience something better or live a better life. This is an issue in US too, and this is exactly why I believe Green New Deal is the right things to enact, as it calls for protection for “frontline and vulnerable people” during a period of massive economic changes, while offering people new opportunities.



<br><hr>
I agree with you. After reading the Green New Deal, I have two feelings: first, I believe it makes many good proposals; second, I don't believe we can achieve most of the goals. For example, at the end it mentions: "providing all people of the United States with—high-quality health care; affordable, safe, and adequate housing; economic security; and clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and access to nature." Ideal iswonderful, but reality is cruel. We recognized the climate issue decades ago and knew what we should do to change the situation. But many years passed, not only has the situation not improved, but it has become worse. Over time, we produce more and more pollution. There are always many wealthy and powerful people in society that consider only their own interests, not the consequences of the future. Their presence makes the plan difficult to achieve. Although I am pessimistic about achieving the Green New Deal, I feel we still need to do our best to achieve some of the goals. When these goals are achieved, we can implement the remaining goals step by step. There is no doubt that the whole process will take a long time. The problem is we are not sure if the time left for us is enough.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that degrowth is the only effective way to mitigate the crisis and have a sustainable living. As you said, this is the method only appliable in the wealthy, developed countries like the United States. For the developing countries like Bangladesh mentioned in the video, they need to make every citizen live in a higher standard life in a sustainable, environmental-friendly way. Besides, I really appreciate you said that these countries’ low level of development is not due to the inferiority of the race, but a long history of imperialism, so that they should and deserve to achieve a development. It is unreasonable to force those countries to apply the same solution as the United States.



<br><hr>
I agree with the fact that something needs to be done. The push that our economy has definitely caused many issues. If we stop growing that would put an end to the damage that we do. I'm just worried about what a stop in growth would do to us all. I'm just a freshman and I grew up in the capitalist system. I'm barely getting my feet wet in the real world and I worry what would happen if we stopped growing and if it would potentially put me and my family at risk. What would change. I guess the biggest thing is I'm scared of what could happen.



<br><hr>
I agree with everything you've said. It seems as though the United States wants to go through every possible cheaper smaller solution before "taking the bull by the horns". We no longer have the luxury of time, we have to take big actions, in multiple sectors, fast. Like you said there are branches to capitalism such as  "petrocapitalism, hyperconsumerism, anthropocentrism, structural racism, the remnant legacies of colonialism, materialism", once these small root issues are solved the big one of capitalism will take care of itself. However this must be done through policy, which will be changed through our leaders, who we are accountable as a generation to voting in. It is crazy that only so few of our age range 18 - 25 vote, when our minds are filled with the most current knowledge, and we have a better understanding of the topic of environmental, social, and climate injustice. However because we do not all partake in even a simple vote, our voices are not the ones heard when decisions are made around this topics, rather its left up to "the boomers". If we all used our power to choose the causes we believe in, I feel like we would be in a much better current standing, environmental friendly laws would be put into action immediately. 
<br><br>
We are growing up in a world where materials such as cars, clothing, foods, have to be from the best name brand, must be "insta worthy" and are such a big focus of our self value and ego.We are searching for happiness when really at the root of it we are just feeding into a cause that has the power to create destruction and the exact opposite of "happiness" for many people.
<br><br>
Americans are often close minded and selfish in the way that they don't see how our actions affect people all over the world. From producing 25% of the carbon admissions that damaged the environment and created natural disasters that took the homes of 30 million people in Bangladesh alone last year. I think that is truly what it all comes down to, selfishness, always wanting "bigger and better" without giving thought to the implications. I believe Americans need some "regrowth" to slow them down, ground them, and remind them of what truly matters.



<br><hr>
Hello Randy, I agree with how you feel it is ridiculous to try to fix the issues of climate crisis and social inequality while still going economically. I really liked your analogy of how it is like helping a soldier heal from his bullet wounds without removing the bullets. I have never heard of the concept “Degrowth” so I am glad that Ken mentioned it in his lecture. Yeah, in order for us to really solve issues and potentially grow economically we must address a series of issues that are related to the root problem. We surpassed the time for exponential growth and we must now try to reduce our population. I agree how Americans need to focus on the good of degrowth rather than the negative connotations it may have.Yes, it may suck to have less resources but society as a whole will gain more overall happiness. 
 <br><br>
I agree that degrowth is only good for the developed countries. Just like what Ken said, first world problems would not be a problem in Bangladesh . It is so absurd how obesity affects 40% of the United States population while Bangladesh has over 40 million people who are hungry. The developing world needs to continue to grow while the United States takes a step back.  The “American Dream” is not worth the detrimental effects to the rest of the world. I liked how Ken referenced one of the movies we watched, the True Cost because it is a clear example how the United States selfishness caused so much injustice to developing countries. The developed countries such as the United States needs to do more to help out these struggling countries.



<br><hr>
After reading the article, I completely agree with you. Also, I want to fight undeveloped countries for justice. Since developed countries have already taken so much resources, and emit a large amount of green house gases, letting undeveloped countries to suffer from the disasters which brought by the climate, and this was mainly caused by developed countries, but it let undeveloped countries to suffer from it, and developed countries barely don't suffer from it. After reading the article, I found that degrowth is important for human to survive, since we have already excavate so many from earth, and if we continually take things from Earth without bringing back or protect Earth, soon in the future, we will have no place to live. However, with many solutions provided by the article, I believe that we still have chance to save our Earth, as long as we take action right now.



<br><hr>
I agree with you, I really like the idea of degrowth, it’s not a very popular idea, in fact I haven’t heard of degrowth being spoken in a positive way before yet it is a very important concept. This idea is essential to keep with the agreements proposed in The Green New Deal, which proposed to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels. We cannot address this issue without addressing our economy and projected growth. The United States is one of the richest and most advanced countries in the world, which means we are also one of the biggest consumers and the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, therefore, we need to make the most effort and the biggest cuts in order to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees. Ken also brings up a crucial point, all countries in the world won’t have to make equal cuts, the example used in the video is the USA and Bangladesh, we consume and produce a lot more than Bangladesh therefore we will have to make much more significant cuts in our carbon footprint compared to a country such as Bangladesh. We need to address the way our economy functions, like you said we are a profit driven market, and we will maximize our profits no matter what the cost, we need to revise this way of thinking before it costs us our planet and I loved your idea about shifting our ideas from increasing profit to increasing happiness.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. People are so caught up in fixing the outside instead of finding and study the root of the problem. I did not realize how other people are impacted by environmental problems before watching this video, and I would never think about that if I never watched it. People are living in their own little circles of life, and what they thought about what the climate crisis impacts are only themselves, including myself. We have done too much of what we were not supposed to, and we have gone so far from the limits. People from developing countries are usually so proud of what they have, what they have done to improve human lives, but ignoring the consequences of it. And to save or undo what we have done, the United States, being the country that has the greatest emission of the world, needs to do something to help those countries, those people who actually did nothing but living their lives with much lower carbon footprint than the people in the United States.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with your points about degrowth. There is no way that the United States cannot continue its capitalist economy and expect environmental justice to be achieved. The preservation of a growing economy is not working in our favor now, and will continue to not work in our favor in the future. The deprioritization of economic growth and a switch to something that will bring us much more happiness. When considering the process of degrowth for the United States, you are correct to state that we shouldn't take away those economic opportunities for "developing" nations. Because developed nations like the United States are creating much more of an impact on the climate crisis, it is imperative that we implement practices of degrowth.



<br><hr>
I'm not sure I really see this as a point of "Degrowth" but rather, changing directions from a known dead end onto a path that will keep us moving forward. We're just backing up a bit so when can recalculate our country for the better. This is what i believe the new deal entails. I definitely agree that the addressing the climate crisis will challenge not only our economic models but even our societies, educations, humanitarian models and so much more. This is why this is such a big problem like you said. And I really like the imagery you gave of a wounded soldier. His body is also made of a bunch of intricate systems that have to be not only treated properly, but changed as a result. The soldier has to become something better suited to what we need them to accomplish. This is a really scary idea to most people like you reminded us. People think we need to go back to the stone age and use rocks and sticks when this is not the case. We just need to re-imagine "Degrowth" as retracing our steps to finding the future of humanity.



<br><hr>
The idea of degrowth is hard to stomach, I consider myself an open-minded and left-leaning individual, but it seems unfair to pay for the irresponsible actions of previous generations to whom I am not even related to by virtue of me being the first generation of my family to be born in the U.S. I don't think there is a 'we' to it, the corporations of the U.S and Europe perpetuated neocolonialism to increase their profit margins for their shareholders. We need to redefine the society we have received from morally corrupt corporations and elect individuals who will enact the painful process of 'degrowth'. Once again many of us pay for the sins of the elite few.



<br><hr>
The concept of degrowth seems like a sensible option, but it misses very important aspects of the production function. If the production function only relied on natural capital and physical capital inputs, it would be impossible to sustain growth while protecting the environment. However, we must take into account improvements in technology and human capital. As technological knowledge grows at an exponential rate, it's true that over time tech will improve and replace our current technology that is detrimental to our environment. As we become more aware of climate change and how to combat it, our human capital devoted to solving this issue will both lead to GDP growth and increasing the speed at which this issue is solved. With improvements to technology and human capital, it is very much so possible to sustain growth in cycles, and protect the environment. 
 <br><br>

On another note, it seems strange to me that so many students want degrowth. Degrowth would lead to a smaller economy and a smaller demand for labor. College students would be the group most detrimentally affected by degerowth and the rise of socialism. We would have paid the extraordinarily high price to improve our human capital by attending university, yet we would have very few jobs in a socialist or declining economy. While it may seem to be a noble cause to fight for the end of capitalism, it really will harm most of us if it is put in place. Ironically, if we look at who it will most help, the retired elderly, they are the people who have caused the climate crisis.

 <br><br>

It is possible for Americans to maintain their standard of living while also changing our habits to help end climate change, but it will require an unprecedented amount of partisan compromise in Congress, new investment plans on Wall Street, and a shift in consumption on Main Street.



<br><hr>
I absolutely love this comment. I agree so much, it's crazy how our government retains this concept that we can grow infinitely when that very concept defies physics, geography, common sense, and even moral standings. There's no viable way to continue to expand when we live on a planet that is built with a set amount of resources. If we end up depleting those stores, then the economy is just going to flat-line, and yes, I do use this with another meaning in connection to life as we know it. Capitalism is such a flawed concept, let's keep growing because growth is power, when all of reality's capabilities are finite. All of these politicians and oil companies live in a realm of delusions where they believe anything they so desire should fall at their fingertips like magic really exists when this planet is truly all we have, yet we treat it like it means absolutely nothing to us.


<br><hr>
I really enjoyed your comment, I think you put this whole problem into great perspective, and it is a truth many are unwilling to admit. "Petrocapitalism, hyper-consumerism, anthropocentrism, structural racism, the remnant legacies of colonialism, materialism, etc. All of these "isms" are rooted in the much larger "ism" that is running our society and the planet into oblivion - capitalism" really hit home with me, and I am scared to admit you may be right. I fear for our future as I am unsure people are willing to change, as no one likes to slow down progress and capitalism only catalyzes growth with competition. I doubt America would ever give up capitalism, but as a country we could at least come together to slow down consumerism and change our energy consumption to renewable energies. Anthropocentrism is something we must face and seek to reduce if we intend to combat climate change and even be here at all.



<br><hr>
I could not agree more with your comment. The idea of degrowth has such a bad connotation that we fail to act and realize that it is in our best interest to slow our economy and focus more on climate justice. We owed to the world, the US only contributed 25% of the total CO2 emissions, yet we are not the ones paying for our actions. We need to collectively address the issues that countries around the globe are facing, but we as individuals are of no knowledge of. Similarly, as Ken mentions our goals differ across countries, in the US we need to drastically change our lifestyle and decrease our consumption, while in undeveloped countries their goal is to implement the use of renewable energy. While watching this video I kept thinking about how much we consume meat, and contribute to the emissions of CO2 as a whole compared to those in Bangladesh, thus it is unbelievable that we praise our economy and we push for more growth, while the gap between the wealthy and the poor keeps growing.



<br><hr>
I agree that “degrowth” is a goal that all first world nations should strive towards for the betterment of society. The Green New Deal is one of the first major pieces of legislation to promote this cause, and more people should be rallying behind it. The problem is that large oil and gas corporations won’t let go of their stronghold on the energy sector easily, and the mass amount of disinformation persuading the public that the Green New Deal is “bad for the economy” is hard to fight against. However, it’s time for people to realize that infinite economic growth is impossible and unsustainable, and that the “American Dream” is just a bunch of shallow and capitalistic desires - such as a large house with a yard and a fancy car -  rather than a way to give one’s life meaning. It is important that first world nations set the example of degrowth for everyone else to follow and hopefully emulate. If the wealthiest nations in the world cannot create a sustainable model for themselves to reduce their enormous carbon footprint, how can we expect developing countries such as India to be environmentally sustainable throughout their entire process of industrialization? While it will be a difficult feat to convince the public to go down the path of degrowth given its connotations, there are viable ways to implement policies such as the Green New Deal and let go of our consumerist ways without the entire economy collapsing. Instituting the Green New Deal will open up plentiful jobs in the energy sector and public infrastructure, for instance; additionally, not making these changes will only harm our economy further because our infrastructure won’t be equipped to handle the more intense side effects of the climate crisis in the future.

I agree-- the use of the word "degrowth" brings a certainty to the conversation that I appreciate. It really shows that developed countries have reached a point where we really cannot ignore the issue. Perhaps if we had acknowledged the risks that greenhouse gas emissions posed to the environment sooner, we would not have to "degrow" to take responsibility for the mess we've made. The Green New Deal is encouraging, because its existence means that there are people in the government who share the same ideas that our class has been stewing over for the duration of the quarter. I am, however, concerned that the document did not quite address specific solutions. I'm not sure if this concern is even warranted, though, because I do not know if it is supposed to be a declaration and call for change or the beginning of said change.


<br><hr>
Agreed. Glad Ken addressed degrowth because to achieve the amount of change we would hope to get to, we first need to put in the time and money. Which is true would place us in economical instability but like any huge project it should be expected. The social programs brought by The New Deal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt provided the push for people to get up on their feet during the Depression; yes it did put us in hella debt but we here now. Low and behold the Green New Deal is similar in trying to bring social programs that help but particularly our most marginalized who get the worst end of Climate Change. 
 <br><br>

I agree other nations, especially developing nations, are dealing with other social, political, and economical issues that our Green New Deal can not address and fix. So the idea of " promoting the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding, and services, with the aim of making the United States the international leader on climate action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal" is great so long as we don't force what our Green New Deal onto other countries (Climate Change looks differently in different parts of the world and each should be addressed accordingly). Would have liked if the Green New Deal or Ken would have addressed this issue.



<br><hr>
True. In economists’ view, the population of a country should slowly growth so it can provide economic benefit. However, our Earth has limit land.  The planet which we live in cannot accommodate too much living things. None of countries wants to be the first one to limit their population and it may lead the problem more serious. Everyone need to know that climate change will affect our live and every countries should do something to stop it.



<br><hr>
I was also interested by the concept of "Degrowth". I feel as though much of the world, especially in the STEM fields, is very focused on rapid improvement and innovation. The concept of "Degrowth" is therefore very foreign and against-agenda for most fields of study. Even so, I feel that a period of time for America where we're focused on living differently rather than living bigger would be overall very beneficial for our country. We need to have some transitionary period in order to reach our emission goals. I think fighting the causes of climate change would naturally bring us to a state of degrowth anyways because of how money-seeking corporations are some of the big offenders of the climate crisis. I wonder what new jobs will appear as we shift away from our polluting trends; hopefully some of these will ease critics of the anti-climate change movement.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with what you said about degrowth in America and around the world. When you said “… we can shift from increasing profits to increasing happiness, from expanding wealth to expanding relationships, from working long hours to spending long hours with our loved ones, and from saving life for after retirement to living right now, in the present,” I was nearly brought to tears. In the US, it seems we have lost sight of what is important. We prioritize money and fame over everything and everyone. We put it above our families: moving millions of miles away for a better paying job. We put it above our loved ones: allowing greed to cloud our minds and skew our priorities. The USA for all we brag, seems to be one of the least happy countries in the world! The suicide rates that nobody talks about and the shootings and violence; our society is not a healthy one. We have let capitalism and consumerism seep into our hearts. Material items take the places of people, the Earth, and relationships in our hearts. It’s like filling a creme puff with toothpaste. It may make your smile look shinier from the outside, but on the inside you feel horrible… because you are eating toothpaste. The creme puff of life can have many different fillings depending on the person, but material possessions are not one of them. 
 <br><br>

In regards to what Ken discussed in his video about the US’ role in environmental, political, economic, and social change when it comes to the climate crisis, I think that we would be hypocrites to call ourselves leaders and “influencers” in the world today if we don’t take charge against climate change. This issue should unite our country. It should be the new space race! Us against the clock in a race to sustainability. We could unite and support the world and our natural counterparts if we just learn to care about life. It’s hard to look at the world and see how torn people are on this issue and not feel hopeless. It’s hard not to lose hope in humanity even, because if something this big and life-threatening can’t unite us, then what can? How do you get people to care? Do you scare them with the truth? Do you try to use values and empathy to connect them back to the Earth? What will work?
 <br><br>

I think that the Green New Deal is a step in the right direction, but it’s not an end goal. It’s only the first clue in an intricate mystery book in which we must solve the case of climate change and all environmental issues on Earth. It’s difficult to see that already something as noncommittal (because it does not enact any policies directly) as the Green New Deal can already be so controversial when we need so much more than that.



<br><hr>
I agree with your, and professor Ken’s assessment that ‘degrowth’ will occur and be necessary (at least temporarily) for us to be able to address the problems in our society (both in the environmental sector with fossil fuels and in the ‘isms’ you listed). This degrowth has to be expected if we are to save our planet, one cannot expect to rework an entire system perfectly without having some initial drop in economic prosperity. However, if we are able to implement the changes required to combat climate change, we will have a chance to grow again, to prosper. In contrast, if we ignore the current problems, our climate will become unsustainable, the economic growth that has occurred in the past few years will be worthless as the Earth becomes less inhabitable. To me, it is relatively simple, I would rather have a slight ‘degrowth’ in which we address the current problems to make life better in the long run than have us ignore our current problems until it is too late, until we have an “uninhabitable Earth” (as described in our first reading).

What is capitalism, really? At its core its just the free exchange of goods and services without government intervention. In principle it doesn't seem that bad, and for the most part it leads to tremendous increases in productivity, development, and wealth in nations that adopt it. Unlike some other economic systems, capitalism doesn't just move wealth around from the rich to the poor, it actually creates new wealth. You use solar panels to make energy, sell it, that's new wealth. You dig up some gold, that's new wealth. You grow some corn, new wealth. Taxing the rich, that's not new. Its just the same money being moved around. But "infinite growth is not possible", how will this growth be sustained? I agree that infinite growth is not possible for a fossil fuel based economy, but to say infinite growth is impossible is pushing it.
 <br><br>

What is this notion of "growth" though. Is it wealth, physical dollars? Is it just the idea of progress, in which case, how can there be too much? Where is the line in the sand where you say, "ok this is enough progress lets just stop here".
 <br><br>

For countries that have benefited from fossil fuel economies the most, there is no room for degrowth. Degrowth would be hiding from a problem rather than solving in. I would argue that it is their responsibility to grow. What we do have is a lot of money that can be used to actually generate solutions. And who is generating these solutions? is it the government? Non-profits? Sort of, but it is also private enterprise, those pesky capitalists. There is a lot of money to be made for environmentally sustainable businesses, and this will only increase. 
 <br><br>

Maybe there is a little room for pruning, but I think we need to focus on growing in new directions rather than degrowing. Capitalism may be to blame for climate change but I think it will play an equal role in the solution.



<br><hr>
I agree that we as a country need to accept that we need to prioritize the planet rather than our growing economy. While the economy is important, its importance pales in comparison to the climate crisis. Besides, at the rate we are emitting CO2 into the atmosphere, we will likely soon face major economic repercussions from the climate crisis anyways. I also think that it is important to note that although the economy may take a hit, it is still important to protect Americans from too many negative effects. Transitioning to being emission-free will cause a lot of workers to lose their jobs, which is why proposals like the Green New Deal that address these issues too are so important. If every American had guaranteed healthcare, they would be less worried about the negative effects of losing their jobs.
 <br><br>


Additionally, I agree that advanced nations have a responsibility to help developing nations as a large part of why these nations are still struggling is systemic racism and a long history of imperialism from many developed nations. These nations are also struggling with a lack of climate and social justice, such as Bangladesh suffering from massive floods caused by the climate crisis and also the Rana Plaza incident. Those events are due in large part to the actions of developed nations. These nations thus have a responsibility to reduce their climate footprints so as not to continue additional catastrophic harm to the planet.



<br><hr>
Capitalism has, unfortunately, not only brought good but also a lot of bad when it comes to tendencies that negatively affect the environment as a result of a capitalistic lifestyle. It has for so long, polluted and corrupted the political system we have, so much so, to the point that as long as they’re getting paid enough by large companies, the environment can pay the price. This is why I think the Green New Deal is a great solution to this problem, however, I see a lot of problems associated with convincing so many people to disband many of the practices and traditions that they’ve grown up with and have taught to their children the entire time. In order to combat this, what we must do, is to create a new mindset for people to have; instead of the “American Dream” where a lot of materialistic things matter, we should refocus values on other things like the people and relationships we have with those people. Although it seems hard, I also like to ponder what would have happened had the US spent the same amount of money on green efficient things rather than the billions they put into selling the American lifestyle as suburbia with everyone driving a car.



<br><hr>
I agree with Randy, the only way to truly mitigate our climate crisis in America is to change the very basis of our capitalist system. This system is what created our insanely consumption heavy society which has caused so many problems, such as environmental issues and severe economic inequalities between the rich and the poor. The concept of “Degrowth” is something that has to become a prominent aspect in American society. We need to start slowing down and focusing on family and life essentials instead of economic gain and mass consumption. Just as Randy stated, Americans won’t take kindly to the idea of regression but its a harsh fact that we will need to face. All developed countries should practice degrowth in the near future. As the richest countries being the biggest contributors to climate change, we deserve to help countries such as Bangladesh in these times of crisis due to the effects of climate change. Each year in Bangladesh 10,000 square miles of the country is flooded due to sea level rise resulting in the deaths of 5,000 people and destroying over 6 million homes. This is a devastating fact and we know it is caused by developed countries because there are 2.5 flights per person per year in American but in Bangladesh 1 in 55 people fly every year, so the bigger impact on our climate is quite clearly America. I think the Green New Deal should be put into action in order to reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible through government action.



<br><hr>
I could not agree more on how people ridiculously think that they can address these problems under current economic model. Profit-driven capitalism has been around for so long and have effect on shaping of the world so prominent that I believe it would not only be hard but impossible to change. The Green New Deal and degrowth would not work sadly because luxurious life has been pictured as a necessity, a goal in American culture and other cultures that have been deeply effected because of American's influence. As a visitor, I observed that even within this country, wealth gap has been huge. How can The Green New Deal being deployed when only a fraction of people from the developed countries have enjoyed benefits from capitalism?



<br><hr>
I agree with your main point on how the US seems to think that they can solve the climate crisis without changing its economy. Especially with fossil fuels having so much political support due to lobbyists, things cannot be fixed if those who benefit from the problem are the ones who are in charge. As you also stated, only developed countries such as the US have the luxury to apply the concept of Degrowth to their country. The world powers are always compared in many ways such as the amount of C02 emitted but what people often times overlook is that the US population is just a fraction of the other major emitters of C02. And a huge injustice from this is that the people who who suffer first and most from climate change are the poorer countries that allowed the US to be as comfortable as it is today. And even the ones who will suffer in the US will be the ones of lower income compared to those who chose to emit such large amounts of C02. The good thing is that more and more people are becoming aware and each disaster pushes more people to act. We can only hope that it does not take an even bigger disaster than the ones that have already occured for the world to take action. Specifically in the Green New Deal, the major flaw is that there is no means to enforce the goals of the piece but it truly is all that is missing. The goals are very clear and very possible as well as plans to negate what negative impacts the deal would have. This brings it back to how there has to be a way to enforce the deal because a certainty of the deal is that people will lose their jobs and undoubtedly suffer so there will be programs in place to help those people. It is vital that these programs will be guaranteed for even a chance of having affected working people to support it.


<br><hr>
I really like how you outlined your perception on what degrowth should look like, especially the aspect of shifting from a focus on economic growth and progress to prioritizing human growth and progress. I believe that it's crucial to redefine what growth means to us, to encompass more than financial benefits that, as we have learned, only go to a small portion of the population. I think taking a holistic approach on this issue is necessary, as looking at growth in solely economic outputs not only excludes various communities and portions of the population, but also ignores the deep interconnectedness of society as whole. To address these questions around social, environmental and climate justice, we need to stop looking at the world from a fragmented lens and instead begin to understand it as a system, recognizing the relationships and interconnectedness of its different parts.


<br><hr>
In response to Randy, I am also happy you brought up the idea of "Degrowth." I also personally believe that the capitalist system has directly and indirectly caused a lot of the problems we see today involving global warming. More development and greater consumption levels put pressure on environmental variables. There can’t be infinite growth in a world of limited resources. Economic freedom also means that companies do not take into account the ecosystems that they are destroying in order to grow their market share and profits. In  turn, this also ramps up consumerism...another huge issue. So that is why the notion of "Degrowth" is essential as we as a country need to work on sustaining what we already have instead of focusing on what we don't need. We need to shift simply because otherwise we are going to reach a plateau and then simply crash. I feel people think that any type of regression means you're taking a step in the wrong direction, that is wrong. It can mean prevention, sustainability, foundation, structure, etc.



<br><hr>
Randy your comment invoked both a sense of fear and excitement within me. As much as I think capitalism is a large part of our problem today, I think that a total disband of the system at this point would cause a lot of  chaos. For this reason, I think that we should try are best working within our Capitalist system in a positive way through conscious consumerism and conscious creativity. In the future however, maybe a governmental change is in order. I don't think it's possible for our government to maintain such a large group of people. Early human originally lived in small groups. Perhaps we can disband into small, commune-like groups.



<br><hr>
I worry that we will never be able to move away from capitalism because of our country’s intense connection and deep roots embedded in capitalism. If we don’t move away from capitalism all of the issues that we face environmentally, socially, and economically will never be fixed. There is so much gridlock and lack of action that I wonder how that will ever change. It is stressful because we are running out of time and all the actions we take seem to be insignificant in the grand scheme of things. The government has so much control and yet does nothing. Learning about the Green New Deal and all of its goals and the possibilities it can create makes me so excited but then I think about how impossible it seems in today's America. People think of capitalism as a right and part of their freedom, if that is taken away people would be outraged.



<br><hr>
I agree with you, in order for there to be any progress of change within our world concerning climate change, our country and other developed countries need to learn how to degrowth or just stop growing in general. Underdeveloped countries have not contributed a great amount to this climate crisis due to the fact that they are not advanced in a lot of things we are and other developed growing countries are. Capitalism is the fatal blow to our climate and environment yet people do not see it that way. They see capitalism as a great factor for our country and not a factor that is destroying our world. The Green New Deal states that we will have to cut back on a lot of things we see as a necessity; things that are seen as the “American Life” and “The American Lifestyle”. The only problem with this is that people are not willing to give up these privileges because of how selfish they are.



<br><hr>
I find what you said to be really interesting. What comes to mind is the enzyme model in terms of temperature and its rate of reaction. The enzyme model depicts an increase in the rate of reaction until it hits an optimal temperature and then it starts to decrease quite heavily. This can be likened to the concept of growth and capitalism. I am a firm believer that capitalism brings a lot to great things for economic development and growth. It aids in growing many industries in various sectors which in turn allows the growth of the nation's GDP and their overall standard of living. Further, this all seems so appealing until it reaches its optimum point of growth. It gets to a point when you start questioning whether the outcome justifies the means. It gets to a point where the detrimental effects start outweighing the benefits, which is what is currently happening. Further, as you also mentioned the growth of many developed countries has increased the disparity between them and already developed countries like the US. Thus, you bring in the concept of degrowth.  A concept in which I wasn't too knowledgeable on before. However, after doing some research, I do think it is absolutely imperative that we allow these developing countries to achieve some form of development and growth.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with everything you said. The Green New Deal states, climate change is mostly caused by developed countries that have worsened systemic racial, regional, social, environmental, and economic injustices. The fact is that the U.S. is too developed, exploiting too much natural resources, while developing countries like Bangladesh is so undeveloped and encounters destroyed environment. One of the statistics in the reading that shocked me the most is that the U.S. consumes 6,600 percent more meat per capita, fly 14,000 percent more per capita, and own 21,000 percent more cars per capita than Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, individuals are forced to work under terrible conditions while getting very little pay. It is very sad to see that these business owners profit so much off of the hard work that is done by these individuals who gain such little pay. 
 <br><br>
I really like the way you stated the last sentence of your second paragraph. A lot of individuals in the U.S. are so caught up in how much money they can make and working these long hard hours. In reality, we should be more focused on spending time with our loved ones and building relationships to gain happiness. I feel that we are taught to believe our goal is to make as much money as possible which will make you feel "happy." I personally think happiness will come when you find what you're doing is making a positive impact on your life along with others around you.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with the idea of "degrowth." Although it's hard to implement the concept of degrowth in a society that consumerism is prevalent, degrowth really helps our country become environmentally sustainable. During the past five centuries, the western world has exploited resources from other continents, leaving them undeveloped and contaminated the local environment. It's time for us to degrowth. Degrowth doesn't necessarily means slow down the development of our society, but rather figure out a way for a development that is environmentally sustainable, such as using clean energy.



<br><hr>
I agree with Randy that the concept of degrowth is necessary.  I think the point he made about the economy needs to change and human lifestyles as well.  I think this is great to make the change, but a lot of change is not going to happen all at once.  I think we need to find a perfect balance between maintaining our lives right now and make subtle adjustments to follow through with lifestyle changes that would not fall apart due to people not being able to keep up with their change because it is very drastic and hard to achieve. 
  <br><br>

Going off of his next comment about the developing countries I think we can connect this topic of finding the balance for an overall better environment by helping them out.  I think the developed countries should help developing countries to grow sustainably and responsibly.  This will create a balance that will overall help the planet instead of overworking the underdeveloped countries for the developed countries' needs.



<br><hr>
I agree with you completely. It is completely understandable that if the United States contributes to “20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions” and has “a high technological capacity,” we should be the one that’s going to take the first step on making changes in reducing emissions both culturally and economically. Less flying, less consumption, and less demand on fossil fuel, all of these ideas should be taking fast and seriously, because we are running out of time. And also, developed countries like the US should lend a helping hand to countries that are struggling(Bangladesh, Nigeria, and much more). Since they are more vulnerable to the consequences of climate change while contributing the least on carbon emissions.



<br><hr>
Honestly, I had never thought about degrowth and now learning about its place in the climate crisis is extremely eye opening for me. We cannot expect to address the climate crisis without affecting economics in some way. The profit-driven, capitalist system creates vicious materialism that feeds the climate crisis with constant production. I really enjoyed the analogy provided as it helps to visualize this great problem that threatens the planet and its life. The roots of the issues must be uncovered, which is why it is so difficult. So much of it has to do with culture and the hyperconsumerism, petrocapitalism, etc. that was mentioned is so engrained in society and history. The concept of degrowth sounds scary and when I first heard it I was apprehensive. But learning more about what degrowth truly is without misconstruing it with a set back, but instead focusing on other things outside of infinite growth like people. 

  <br><br>



It's important that degrowth can really only apply these big, rich countries like the United States. The United States success in development has come at the price of the environment while underdeveloped countries who have much, much smaller carbon footprints will face consequences.



<br><hr>
The Green New Deal is one of the most well-known examples that the science community tries to communicate with political power and ask for adoption, and therefore it is quite interesting to see that in the deal, they mainly state the damage to the United States if the climate continues to change and temperature rises beyond 2 degrees. However, as many of my fellows say, these measurements are without practical value to politicians as most of them are overly demanding, even for nation like the United States, a nation with so many obese people eating meat on the plane. It is quite shocking to think that in total, for a person in Bangladesh to do the same stupid thing, the chance can be comparable to winning a lottery ticket. Even though these underdeveloped countries have their environment destroyed by factories possessed by those developed countries, it is logically unreasonable to demand developed countries such as the United States to compensate these nations, as they choose the path to a trade environment for money. Therefore, investing money in these regions may appear to be like donations and charity purposes just to draw more election tickets, and these funds can be withdrawn so quickly since the Donald administration doesn’t give a shit about environmental protection. However, I have doubt that with these funds, will they get out of the dilemma eventually? Or they will still be the factory of developed countries while being squeezed of their cheap labor and even the moderate living standard.



<br><hr>
I agree with you in that degrowth and sustainable living coincide, degrowth is necessary for sustainable living.  The Green New Deal is a step in the right direction, as are many solutions.  But a step in the right direction isn’t always enough when society isn’t willing to consider it.  Following the Green New Deal would mean many Americans would have to cut back on things that are part of their daily life, which isn’t the most appealing to most people.  Unfortunately it doesn’t seem likely that degrowth is something that Americans will consider.



<br><hr>
Yours is the best comment I have seen under this video. I totally agree with what you have. This world today is focusing on economic growth too much, especially developed countries. People from developed countries spend a huge amount of money buying unnecessary stuff to satisfy their spiritual wants while people from undeveloped countries are still suffered from lack of food and other basic living supplies. It's unfair to ask those people undeveloped countries to give up eating or other stuff to protect the environment for the people from developed countries. It is also unfair to ask developed countries to stop their economic growth because once they stop, the economy of the whole world will crush: the huge unemployment rate can bring down all governments. The best way and the only way for the human to make all things right is like what you said: they have to change all directions of economic growth toward human growth instead of putting efforts in unnecessary "luxury" items. What I mean for human growth are education and health care. These two are probably the two most important fields in human society and do have potentials to bring up a vast economic growth.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with you, and it will take much convincing for a large portion of America. We have had the America dream (which is largely capitalist based) instilled in us our entire lives, and it is our responsibility to change the minds of many and teach the generations to come.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that we have been increasing economies for so long without considering how much external cost we imposed on the earth and the vulnerable people. Instead, we should incorporate the concept of “degrowth,” and it will be challenging for us to go through the transition period. We have to change the way we live, and we have to look into the problem profoundly rather than staying at the surface of the issue. The environmental issue is not a political issue, and it should not be a target of the political campaign so that we should follow the green new deal and push forward the regulation on emissions. Furthermore, in the transition period, the government has the responsibility to promises jobs, public employment, universal healthcare, education, and training, which rebuild the economy in a way that allows a fair opportunity. I’m surprised that not all people have healthcare, and this is vulnerable to those who have low income. Combine with other social problems. We should consider them all together as they are often closely related. Some people believe that we think too optimistic about the practices of the New Green Deal, but I believe that nothing is impossible. It is a matter of our choice and actions. If we act on the knowledge we have, we turn that knowledge into power.



<br><hr>
I totally agree with what you said. I like your view so much. I came from a developing country, China. Although a lot of people think China is a developed country, the truth is China is not. The average income of Chinese is only $19000, which is 76th place in the world. A lot of countries are poor because people lacks the knowledge to create wealth and products. For example, countries in America, only six percent of people accept higher education. They are poor because they don't know how to not become poor. This is the biggest unfairness in the world. Some people are poor not because they are lazy or stupid, they are poor because of their birth.  So we should do something to help them to become rich.



<br><hr>
I agree with you in that degrowth is one of the only sensible solutions for our generations climate crisis. It is no misconception that the rich contribute more greenhouse gasses to the climate crisis than that of a poor community or a poorer country. This in itself is absurd and has to be regulated. Years and years of economic growth backed by bad greenhouse gas emission habits have caused an unparalleled complication that the word must deal with. I believe that the green new deal addresses a lot of the issues that we are facing in terms of changing the way we live for the improvement of the environment. The climate crisis we are facing today is an effect of the way that we as a country have standardized living. If we don't take the steps necessary to shift our standard of living to a more clean and eco friendly way then the climate crisis can only get worse. It seems like an unrealistic crisis to be solved due to the fact that we have normalized the way we shop, eat, and expend resources. If we really want to see the world do better then we as a country have to choose better.



<br><hr>
I want to say the same thing about degradation. If a country's people have adapted to a sustainable way of life, its economic growth cannot be maintained at the current or previous levels. Imagine people switching to a plant-based diet, taking public transport or zero-emission cars, and the diversity of goods and services will be greatly reduced. There is less demand for different products and less supply. That would surely slow growth. So I quite agree with you that those who insist that we can prevent climate and social injustice without affecting the economy are foolish. However, I have a slightly different idea of your opinion that going to the growth initiative would be the only sensible solution for advanced and wealthy countries such as the United States. I really don't think the developed countries, especially the United States, are going to give up, or somehow not lower their economic priorities. With a President like trump, environmental justice will be ignored and delayed. While this is true, countries can still do something without seriously damaging their economies. For example, I am from Shanghai, China. As far as I know, China's environmental policies and infrastructure are not very widespread and mature, but since the winter of 2019, Shanghai has established an extremely strict household waste management system. The law requires every household, business and community to divide their daily waste into four categories: dry, wet (kitchen), recyclable and hazardous. Those who disobey will be fined. I am personally very pleased to see that my country is finally paying attention and actually taking action to solve environmental problems. It made me realize that even a developed country like ours can be the first step in making such fundamental changes that call for more personal attention and concern, even though many countries around the world have already done so. It still makes me proud.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with everything you had to say. I too appreciated the fact that Ken brought up the concept of degrowth, because it is necessary for sustainable living. I like how you brought up that degrowth doesn't apply on a global scale because of other developing nations that haven't even had the opportunity y to grow as much as we have. I think a lot of people are afraid of the idea of degrowth because they feel as if it would be taking a step backwards. I think that our best bet would be to try and educate those who are apprehensive about the green new deal and make them understand  the urgency and importance of climate change.

I really like your comment on the concept of degrowth here. I feel like too often climate change deniers are focused on that concept and that degrowth of the economy is such a bad thing in their heads that they would risk anything and everything to prevent it. This, in my opinion, puts too much value on the economy as a source of growth rather than any other alternatives. For too long, we have measured the progress of a country sully on this idea and the wealth that accompanies it, when really I feel like that should have never been the source of progress in the first place. Growing as a people and as a society with happiness and a sense of community and joy seems so much more important than just the materials that community possesses. What does it matter how many articles of clothing someone has if they aren't happy wearing any of them? Have you really made progress and growth when you're wasting all of your money? I think these are important issues that we need to address as we address the climate crisis, because once people start to realize that there is a better option and that they can be happy rather than just wealthy then I feel like degrowth will seem a lot less scary and vile than it has been made out to be.

When learning about the needed shift to a more frugal lifestyle, I was thinking about how difficult it will be for our society to shift to being less productive and less consumptive. I think it will be incredibly difficult for most people in our country to wrap their head around this concept. Considering we elected somebody like Donald Trump, it is very difficult to think that especially people like his constituents will take kindly to the concept of Degrowth. It is nontheless difficult for me to accept it. While it would be very nice to be able to relax and have my life geared towards things that aren't economic productivity, it is just as hard for me to shy away from building a life in which I'm financially free to do what I please and to take care of the people around me. Personally, this is forcing me to grapple difficult ideas and also has me thinking about how large of a change is required for our country.

I completely agree with you, it is so true that wealthier people have greater demanding and especially in capitalism countries like the US, people demand more stuffs which negatively influences the “degrowth” that a lot of people are working for. It is obvious that for protecting the environment, people need to decrease the demand so that less stuffs are going to be needed, but how can people achieve it when everyone is keeping asking for more while shouting the slogan “we need to protect the environment”

You are right that degradation is essential for sustainable living.It is this system that gradually exposes these problems. However, some people do nothing but scratch the surface and do not solve any problems at all.I think we urgently need a new green system that fully supports our idea of green living. I know that it is very difficult to achieve this, because it is the complete opposite of the "American dream". There may be many people against it, but we still have to do it, because only then can we have a better future.

This video made me think about things I have NEVER thought about before. It's the first video that has actually made me think about how ignorant I really am. 
  <br><br>

I am from the valley. Throughout high school, there were fires near my hometown every October/November. In two instances, ash was raining down in my backyard. During the Woolsey Fire, my neighborhood lost power for 24 hours. I was charging my phone in my dad's car and I got an emergency text message that we had to evacuate. That night, all I could think about was whether or not my house would still be there the next day. I took photos of all of the rooms and I gathered my most sentimental items. In the end, my neighborhood was okay, but a lot of other houses were lost in these fires -- including houses of my friends from school. However, the amount of houses lost is incomparable to what it could have been had there been no firefighters and emergency warnings. At one point, the fire was just across the street from my high school. Thanks to the readiness and hard work of the firefighters, my high school was saved. 
  <br><br>

Three weeks later, I remember feeling, for the first time in my life, relieved to be back at school. My Spanish teacher let us write diary entries about how we were feeling. I wrote about how I was sad and scared during the fires but now that it was all over I felt grateful. I still had my house. 
  <br><br>

When Ken mentioned that it cost hundreds of million dollars to treat the Thomas fire, I realized something. I've NEVER thought about the costs of treating a fire. In fact, I didn't think that it cost anything. I thought it only cost money to treat the damage after the fire is over. However, now I know that all of those firefighters, all of the equipment, all of the emergency services, all of the firetrucks, all of the water, and all of the helicopters -- they didn't help us for free. They helped us because we can afford it. In places like Bangladesh, they can't afford those services and therefore they have none at all. If a fire is encroaching on their neighborhood, they can't sit and wait to be evacuated and they can't rely on other people to save their houses like my neighborhood did. They have to fight for themselves, and pray that they can survive. It just blows my mind how I never thought about any of this before.

I too did not realize how much money it costs to fight fires until watching this video. As you said, the costs are not just to repair damage after the fires, but to treat the actual fire as it is going on. You never think about how much it costs to supply emergency services and equip the thousands of firefighters that are active during a fire. We are so fortunate to live in a country where our local governments can afford to provide these emergency services. Yet, as global temperatures rise, fires will become more frequent, dangerous, and last longer. An example of this is the Australia bush fire that lasted 210 days. This epidemic is especially dangerous in the hotter, poorer regions of the world. In these areas, the countries cannot afford to protect themselves against the fires. They lose their homes and lives because they have nowhere to go. Similar effects are seen with other natural disasters, such as floods in Bangladesh. 5,000 people are killed every year during floods. Their lives are being threatened by the changing climate each year, and they have no resources to protect themselves from it.

I know exactly how you feel, I come from the valley too where I am so use to the firefighters helping out our farmers since my town has one of the driest weathers in the valley during the summer. But I never realized how much money goes into this whole process of putting out a fire and making sure everyone is protected. I knew how much stuff went into the process, especially since I had a friend who trained to be a firefighter during his Senior year of high school, but I never really thought about it economically. We have so much money, so many resources, and so many outlets to protect and save as much as we can during environmental disasters in the United States, yet we put so much of that money into FIXING what happens DURING AND AFTER the disaster and not putting as much money towards PREVENTING the disaster from even happening. I believe that if the government really cared about protecting their citizens from these disasters, they need to start implementing ways to fix climate issues so that way in 2050 we won't face, like how the Green New Deal states, wildfires that will will annually burn at least twice as much forest area in the western United States than was typically burned by wildfires in the years preceding 2019.

  <br><br>

I also never thought about how the developing countries have a lack of resources to deal with similar environmental catastrophes, especially with what is happening in Bangladesh. I thought majority of those countries will AT LEAST have outside support, such as Puerto Rico receiving aid from the United States when they faced the destruction of Hurricane Maria. But hearing how the Trump administration has pulled out support for a country struggling to survive because of our selfish actions is ridiculous. If we have enough money, enough resources, enough supplies to help us and to also WASTE those supplies, we should give those resources to those who need it. If this country wants to act like a major global leader, then we should act like one.




<br><hr>
I totally have the same feeling after I watched this video. From reading, it was shocking for me when I looked at the statistics, which showed that America needs to take responsibility for nearly 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the world. It shocked me more when Ken compared the contribution to CO2 emissions of the United States to Bangladesh. That country does not contribute as much as the United States, but they have to suffer from the same disaster brought by global warming since climate change is a global effect. Many people until now have not realized how serious this problem is because the climate change still does not influence their life- fire, floods, and some other disasters mentioned in the reading have not destroyed their home. However, our life seems more peaceful because the government of our country can deal with this kind of problem. How about some other countries that are poorer and weaker? Can we try to consider the situation before we decide to waste some resources that we have? To be honest, to protect the environment is not only for other people but also for ourselves. If we do not stop now and just let global warming surpass 2 degrees Celsius and leave alone, the situation and disaster brought by this issue will become worse and worse. We will face the case that our government cannot solve it one day in the future if we do not stop now. 

  <br><br>

After reading this Green New Deal, I still have some hope on this problem. It introduced a considerable amount of solutions and goals on every aspect of this problem. We should take action now and prevent the consequences mentioned in this article from taking place in our life.




<br><hr>
I’m sorry to hear your experience. But your story makes me think of that if the wild fire is already so infectious to people living in first world countries, what would life be for those people in Bangladesh when natural disasters take place?
  <br><br>


If we think of it, life is truly unfair for people in developing countries. I’ve heard people saying that your wealth is determined by yourself. But imagine if you are born in a Bangladesh village, your grandmother is sick in bed due to consuming the polluted water day after day, your mother died in an accident in sweatshop, your father works 14 hours a day in order to support your family. You want to go to school but school was destroyed by flood weeks ago, the teachers and anyone with some money have decided to flee this hopeless place. In this case, not only are you lacking chances of being educated, but you are also burdened by family and tied up to this place. 
  <br><br>


Certainly should the first world countries give a helping head to those people who are struggling. But that is clearly not what US is doing currently.




<br><hr>

I also feel very ignorant because I never thought about how much it cost to treat a big fire like the Thomas Fire. Like you said, we tend to look at the damage that fire has caused rather than the effort, cost of treating the fire. I also really like the Ken makes the environmental injustice concept more clear. It makes me feel sad that Bangladesh couldn't afford to fix the damage during the flood, leaving 30 million people homeless. It's important to emphasize the irony that the U.S put the most CO2 emission in the developed countries, and poor countries like Bangladesh feel the most devastating environmental hazards. The Green New Deal is absolutely necessary. It will create more jobs, making people live healthier, more sustainable. I like how the Green New Deal also address the environmental injustice, helping low-income families, vulnerable people, the poor in other countries. Like trade rules that have environmental protections and work on economic development for vulnerable communities, decreasing the gap of social, environmental injustice.

I totally understand you because I also grew up in the valley and, especially during my high school years, the forest fires were so big and i would always worry that I'd have to evacuate in case my home was affected. I remember my sophomore year, my aunt was turning 50 and she planned a big party at her house in the hills, but because of the fire they had to evacuate and we didn't have the party. Compared to other people's situations, we were actually lucky because her house didn't get affected too badly and everything was fine after. But thinking about how other people's entire houses were burnt down makes me realize how lucky I was to not have to face that problem. 

  <br><br>

I often fail to think about how the climate crisis affects people outside of my little circle, but it's crazy to think that many people don't even have the resources to fight against these big fires or rebuild their homes even. We need to work towards making that available for everyone as well as preventing worse fires from happening.



<br><hr>
First of all, I'm sorry that you had to endure such a dramatic experience. Just like you, I was also close to both the Woolsey and Thomas Fires, so I know how intense that had to be for you. I also didn't think about the costs of fighting a fire. All that I was worried about was that this fire could be contained so that my house and all the other houses around it would be fine. I wasn't nearly as close to the fire as you, but nonetheless it was still scary. It's crazy to think that in less developed countries, they don't have well-funded firefighting programs, so their fires would just continue to grow.
  <br><br>

I also think that a big part of it has to deal with the types of government aswell. We are very fortunate enough that our government recognizes the value in these firefighting programs and other related programs. Even if these less-developed countries had enough money to fight fires, it actually comes down to the type of government and what they value most.




<br><hr>

I agree Leanne, it's kind of funny, and scary, that we often seem to not fully comprehend the effects of these types of events. My high school in the valley had fire drills and other safety tests to prepare us for those kinds of situations, but to be honest, I do not think we would have been prepared for an actual emergency. I think the problem with these types of drills is that everyone knows that it is just a drill and most of the time they do not take it very seriously. Fortunately, I did not have to deal with any serious emergency evacuations while I was in high school, but I know people that have and it can really change your outlook on the concept.
  <br><br>

I feel this is where the heart of the problem lies. I think that because of the nature of today's society, people have almost been desensitized to these types of situations. I feel that this might be because of how some people only see these types of situations on TV or other media so it does not seem real. I think that this is also why people today who live in America, are so ill informed of what is happening in other countries. They may think that since they have groups of people to protect them, then these protectors are just a normal part of every society but as we have seen, this is not always the case. 
  <br><br>

There is a saying that says “Ignorance is bliss” and I have never fully understood what that meant until I was older and began to truly understand what happens on our tiny planet flying through space.




<br><hr>
I can relate to your comment on the ignorance you felt about fires and the fact that they are extremely expensive. When thinking about fires, I never in the past considered all the money that was needed to help fight them. I obviously took into account paying firefighters, but didn't realize that all the resources cost an extreme amount of money. I also can't help but think about the recent wildfires in Australia and how many resources they had, yet it took them about three months to put them out. If a fire on this scale had occurred in a place like Bangladesh, it probably would have caused much more destruction and possibly could have taken an even longer amount of time to put them out. I think that we often take for granted all the privileges we have in the U.S. I think that it would be difficult to even imagine a natural disaster occurring here with no aid or efforts to help stop or prevent it. Other third world counties don't have the money and resources to create resilience to these natural disasters or have the means to help stop them once they occur. 
  <br><br>

Touching on the "Green New Deal", if we take measures to help prevent further damage from climate change, this wouldn't only benefit the U.S., but other countries around the world. It is extremely unfair that we are the ones causing the most environmental damage, yet other places are facing the consequences on a much more severe scale. We need to create systematic change in order to help future generations in America and around the world.




<br><hr>
I could not agree more. It absolutely blew my mind to think about the extremely high costs that all these disasters include in the United States. And it made me realize how lucky we are to have such extensive tools to treat the damage. Because in places like Bangladesh, Ken’s comment about how much flooding occurred each year really shook me. 18% of Bangladesh suffers each year from horrible flooding, without any infrastructure or money to help get them back on their feet. In a place like beautiful Santa Barbara, these issues can be seen as something that happens but that we have the power to fix when things are destroyed. Imagine if the Thomas fire happened and there wasn’t any money for repairs. Thousands of people would be without homes, without jobs, and without any resources that we are so lucky to have. I can really not imagine what that would be like. We need to actively combat climate change immediately because as these disasters start to increase with the climate crisis, more and more will be lost and more and more money will be needed to treat this damage. Why are we spending so much money on things that are destroying our world (fast fashion, airplanes, cars, meat, etc.) and putting so much into big businesses that fuel this carbon production only to have to spend more money on environmental damages and experience more loss of land and life? How will our economy survive if the fossil fuel industries keep destroying our land, causing more disasters and needing millions and millions of dollars to create treatment? We don’t see this in Southern California because we have the resources. But our world is starting to lose valuable land and societies in other developing parts of the world that we aren’t even thinking about.




<br><hr>

I think it is scary that us as Americans have become so self-concerned and unaware/ignorant of the world. A great injustice on your perspective has been perpetrated, to no fault of your own or anyone else who feels this way. We cannot know what we don’t see, and unfortunately not many Americans have their eyes open to how socio-economically immobile many people are around the world. Yes, we have poverty in America, but incomparably to much of the developing world. We have been conditioned to pay attention to only what affects us, and neglect much of what we cannot see, and I think that is what has caused us to delay on climate action until we have begun to feel it literally in our own backyards.


<br><hr>
I also never know this before, which I find myself to be not caring about the climate crisis enough. It is not only about the direct damage we as human beings cause to the planet but also about how much we have done to other people, especially those in poor conditions. It doesn't feel right this way, and we should take everything we have for granted because there is no free lunch. As we live in the first world as Ken says and enjoys the most recent high technologies, convenience, and a good standard of living, we have to also consider those who suffer because of our actions and cultural beliefs about consumption. As you mention that those people in Bangladesh will not have the resources to combat the climate crisis, I feel the same and especially sad. As I see, the climate crisis has risen to a global and social level which no one is exempted from it. And more importantly, as the first world, we have done too much pollution to the planet, and now it is the time for us to correct our actions by implementing D growth and helping the countries in poor conditions with responsibility. There is no asylum under the climate crisis, which makes it essential to be united in combating the climate crisis. Since we have enjoyed the privileges for decades, it is then our responsibility to assist others and lead the undertaking like the clauses in the reading.

It is very impressive to see your comment as you were one of those people who personally encounter a situation like this that you and your family had to evacuate from your house. I can hardly image your feeling when you got the emergence text after losing power for 24 hours, and when you took all the photos of your house wondering if you will be able to see all of these again after you come back. Luckily you house were saved, but I feel really sad for those who lost their living places, those who lost their home with a lot of memories, and those who probably lost their loved ones. When people like you suffering from situation such as camp fire, they probably will not relate it to global warming, and climate crisis, and this is exactly why this class exist, to promote and to educate students more about our environment. And it is depressed to think that we are here in the U.S, thus we have resources and abilities to overcome emergences like this, but how about those poor countries? Same as you, I have never think of this before. I hope everything will get better, for us and for them as well.



<br><hr>

Your comment is so incredibly relatable to me. I also never thought about the costs of fighting a wildfire. My first, and only, encounters with serious fires have been in the last three years since I’ve been in Santa Barbara. From the time I was born to when I was 14 I lived in Massachusetts, a place that worries about snow storms and floods, but never fires. I had never even considered fires as a real danger before because it was so far from my reality. From ages 14-18 I lived in Berkeley, CA. Berkeley is obviously more susceptible to fires than Massachusetts, but in my four years of highschool it was still never a concern or a danger. Cut to the fall quarter of my freshman year at UCSB and suddenly finals are cancelled because of a wildfire. I thought surely that was just a crazy thing that happened, but then there were fires again the next year, and then the next. I’m a third year now and I understand the horrors of fires. Not personally and not first hand, but I’ve learned enough to know it’s no joke. In fact, I think about all the jokes we make as a student community here about how we want fires so we don’t have to take finals like we’re in Harry Potter and at the end of every year there is some disaster that saves us from the disaster of our grades. But this is not a joke. It has never been a joke. And anyway, thinking of that it just goes to show how different something can look when you’re seeing it from all different angles. It terrifies me that fires will get worse even if we start making changes now (that’s not to say that we shouldn’t start making changes immediately @the government)



<br><hr>

Yeah... I feel exactly same with you, and I might never know if I didn't read this reading and your comment. In the past, I thought that putting off a fire just some costs of fuels and wages, and nothing else. However, after reading this article, I cannot imagine that putting off a fire will cost such a bunch of money, and I think that I am so lucky to be alive that firefighters are able to deal with fire, and the government are rich enough to take fire in control. For those countries which don't have sufficient finance to deal with these kinds of catastrophes, like Bangladesh, I cannot imagine how would they deal with them. Therefore, we should protect our Earth, our environment right now, without any hesitation, and if we continue polluting our home, soon we will have no place to live. With many solutions the article provided, I still believe that we can take care of climate change.



<br><hr>

I too had never really thought of the cost of putting a fire out. 8500 firefighters is a crazy amount, and thinking about how all these people need to get paid, gas needs to be bought, etc. was really astonishing. I'm lucky enough to live in a place that hasn't' been affected by extreme fire, but I remember being glad that soccer practice got canceled because the air quality was too bad for us to play in. That's how so extremely privileged I am. Not even really worrying about the fires, instead just taking pictures of the orange ashy skies.
  <br><br>
We are so lucky to be living in a place where access to life-saving utilities a call away, but it's horrible to think about all the 3rd world countries and towns tthere that would be completely obliterated by a fire that would barely do any damage here. All these videos that we watch just make me realize that we as AMERICANS, as individuals and as a whole, are really letting down the underprivileged people in the rest of the world. Will selfishness lead to the demise of our Earth, or are humans compassionate enough to overcome it?



<br><hr>
I'm also from the valley and have had fires near my home. I never realized how expensive the whole process was and the enormous amount of resources required. This is especially devastating when fires happen in developing countries who don't have the means to protect its population and their land from fires. I think this is where Ken's previous points of how climate change affects different parts of the world differently comes into play. Poor countries will likely suffer the most, because for the most part they do not have the means to prevent and curtail fires. It is truly such a privilege to live in a developed country and this is something I feel that many people, myself included, take for granted. I believe it is the duty of developed countries like America to help developing countries when they suffer such natural disasters, as it is developed countries who contribute the most to the climate change that causes these disasters in the first place.




<br><hr>

I am sorry about your experience. Putting down a wildfire costs a huge amount of money. And it is us, the taxpayers are paying for the services. We are lucky living in a developed world with solid wealth. When something bad happens we can come up with a solution. However, I do not think people living in poor countries like Bangladesh can afford mass firefighters. They are more vulnerable than us. If they have something bad like a wildfire, it would be our responsibility to help them since our industries messed up their environment. Or we should just make these companies who build factories pay for the services. It is unfair to take zero responsibility while taking so much from them. I think more charities should be set up to help them or to at least prevent a wildfire.



<br><hr>
I agree with you in regards to the fact that we are extremely privileged that we have a safety net when natural disasters strike. This adds to the contribution that the most unfortunate will be the most impacted by climate change. While we see the frequencies of fires become higher and higher we often rely on the resources that are readily available to us. The people in Bangladesh however. are left in a constant state of detriment Before reading the "Green New Deal" I did not understand how intersectional the issue of climate change is. Often times we look at an issue and isolate it and then try to consider a resolution that will fit the issue. This is not sustainable. The sooner we realize that the issues we face are intertwined with the rest of the world-progress will never be made.

  <br><br>

One thing that really stood out to me while reading the "Green New Deal" was the amount of forces needed in order to combat climate change. These forces ranged from education, the help of the democratic party, and supporting local farmers. I could not wrap my head around the large range of acts that can lead to a great change in the environment. It also surprised me the great detriment that can occur if action is not taken now. The US doesn't want to put in money and lead by example in order to help resolve the climate crisis. As mentioned in the "Green New Deal", 'more than $500,000,000,000 in lost annual economic output in the United States by the year 2100". Either we spend money now willingly to create a better future for upcoming generations or we pay later and leave our children to struggle.




<br><hr>
I agree with you. In my concept, it seems like common sense that firefighters have the responsibility to help us and save our lives when there's a fire taking place. And in my home country, the citizens who got helped won't be charged by anything no matter how bad the situation is. Now I realized the government covered the cost because our government can afford it. However, conditions in those less-developed countries are totally different, just like what you said. Their governments don't have the extra money to cover people's needs, so they can rely on nobody except themselves when an emergency happens.




<br><hr>
I can 100% relate to this comment. Everywhere in Southern California is constantly in flames (I feel like at least), and living in a dry desert environment only makes it worse. Luckily, my house has never had to be evacuated, and my high school has only had to be evacuated once. However, no matter how close the fire was, and seeing it in my friends’ literal backyards, for some reason, I would always get a little nervous, but never really thought that the fires were ever a legitimate threat. The firefighters would always come and do the best they could to stop it, and sometimes they couldn’t save all the houses, but compared to the size of the fires, they would always save a large amount. I, too, never realized how much this cost! I know that firefighting is a career, so they need to be paid for however long they are working, and the materials and all the equipment they use cost money, but I never really thought of this deeply; to me, the fires just happened and were gone every year, and for the most part I didn’t need to worry about it. Now I realize that no matter how close the fire is, I should be thinking of the cost and how grateful I should be that we are able to afford care like that. 
  <br><br>


When we think about climate change I feel as if we should definitely be more wary for poorer places and countries. This reality is sad to face, but I feel as if living in a wealthier country, we never really think how natural events impact people when they cannot afford the care they need. If anyone needs a reason to make changes in their lifestyle, the thought of helping less fortunate people survive should be a motivating factor in itself.




<br><hr>
I was also shocked that I did not realize the actual costs of treating a fire. My hometown was too hit by a fire back in 2008 and although I was young at the time I was still incredibly scared. I remember packing up all our things and being ready to evacuate if need be. The fire thankfully was put out after a couple days and we were able to return back to school as well. After this event however, I returned back to life as usual. I did not really imagine all the costs that went into fighting the blazes and all the resources that are put in. I am incredibly grateful that we have these resources available to us or else my home would've surely been lost. I can only feel for those on poorer countries that don't have the protection that we are fortunate enough to have. This makes me think back to how the developed countries are contributing the most towards emissions and leaving the poor countries to suffer. We in the US are fortunate enough to be saved/rebuild from these disasters due to our change in climate. However, others do not get the same benefits. I think of  a country like the Bahamas, recently hit with the massive hurricane, the country was destroyed. I visited the Bahamas, a few years before the event and it was beautiful and I was heartbroken to see the devastation that happened after the hurricanes. Once again another country is left to pay for the harm that the larger countries have caused yet places like the US has not felt nearly the disastrous impacts of other countries and therefore the politicians have not decided to make a change. We have to be aware of our fortunes and use our safety to promote the safety and well beings of others.

Leanne, I had a similar experience and change in mindset after watching these videos. I've lived in Southern California for the majority of my life and, although I've been lucky to never be as directly affected by the common fires, I've seen the damage its caused in other people's lives. Although I don't remember the name of this specific fire, I remember a huge fire in my area in elementary school. I was at a softball team party, and many of the girls had to leave early because they needed to evacuate their homes. Thankfully, the fire was not close enough to cause any damage to their houses, but I remember it being such a casual thing to have to evacuate. If this had been in another place with less access to emergency services, I know the experience would have been drastically different. I feel as though this privilege is rarely ever acknowledged, despite the amount of fires that happen every single year. I really appreciate that you are able to acknowledge that, as I know many others would just see it as a necessity, when it is in fact a huge luxury.



<br><hr>

This video really forces us Americans to realize how privileged we are compared to the rest of the world. I have never actually experience having a wildfire burning my hometown down, but I do know that it is an extremely scary situation. Therefore, I am sorry for your experience and I am glad that you are safe. I also never thought about the cost of treating a fire. It makes sense to me that those firefighters, equipment,  water, helicopters, etc. did not come for free. However, it never connected in my head that they do cost money until I finished watching this video. As a result, I feel so ignorant regarding the world around me. I cannot imagine living in places like Bangladesh and not having these services when a fire emergency occurs. Like you said, the people in these places such as Bangladesh have to fight for themselves and pray that they can survive. It is frightening to think about these situations, but we must acknowledge that this is the reality of them. As a result, we must try our best to eliminate the inequality between developed and developing countries and help achieve our common goal of saving our planet.

It's crazy to think that there are areas that have little to no ability to help their citizens in times of crisis. As globalization has taken root in the world, and things become more connected, you'd think that areas with surplus or extra arms with which they could help would, but time and time again it seems like these people have to face their trials alone. It is unfortunate to see selfishness take hold of people, grabbing their attention towards themselves instead of the millions who need attention as well.

Your comment is seriously great. I never even took the time myself to consider what it cost to actually treat a fire. I myself have had fires in my are of So Cal. Years ago my local mountains had a very bad fire that caused us to have to evacuate our house and move away for a short while. Similarly, I have had fires in the surrounding areas that would send ash all over our area and make the air difficult to breath. All during that time, I thought about how my house and area would be affected and how the other areas might be affected. I considered the costs it would take to rebuild houses and communities. During this thought process, it never really occurred to me the simple and upfront fact that putting out the fire actually costs money as well. The firefighters and all the equipment and water used, costs money and time and labor. Furthermore I hadn’t even taken the time to think outside of the US where fire response programs didn’t even exist or areas where the people can’t even afford to take on these fires. It is true, these people cannot just expect someone to come in and help them move and evacuate and put out the fires for them. Instead, if they want their property and belongings to be saved, they must save them. It is just unreal to think that people must go through all of this and survive so much while we have the ability to let others take care of the problem.

This lecture also really affected me - the topics Ken brought up here reminded me of The True Cost, and together these two assignments made me feel more deeply sad than anything else we have watched in this class. I can't imagine the fear people in places like Bangladesh feel about natural disasters -- and there is no comfort for them, no back-up plans, no safety protocols. Just blind hope that they will be okay. To answer Ken's question at the end, I absolutely think it is OUR responsibility to help these countries RIGHT AWAY in ensuring they don't have to face impeding environmental disaster. It is our responsibility for two reasons: 1, because we have the resources and they do not, and 2, because we caused so much of this mess for them with our capitalist-growth obsession. 
  <br><br>

While the lecture made me feel angry and sad, the Green New Deal proposal actually gave me this new sensation of hope. Up until reading this, I was really starting to feel like all attempts to stop climate change were insignificant, too small, and too weak. It just felt like no matter what I was watching journalists, scientists, and politicians do in the name of our planet, they kept getting shut down. But I just don't see AOC getting shut down that easily. She's rad. literally. 
  <br><br>

I hadn't really taken the time to understand WHAT the Green New Deal actually entailed before now, and I'm so glad I did. I think that its clear statements and demands are exactly what the climate justice movement needs right now. The proposal basically says we need to rebuild our entire system of democracy in order to save both the people and the planet, and I couldn't agree more.

Leanne, your comment absolutely resonated with me. My friends from the foothills lost their homes and one of my coworkers from Calabasas lost her home in the big California fires; I'm sorry about that traumatic experience. 

  <br><br>

What struck me most and continues to strike me is the sad irony that the wealthiest countries on Earth bear the smallest burden, while places like Bangladesh suffer in relative silence. If 18% of the US was flooded every year and it killed 5000 people, we'd hear about it daily in the news, yet this was the first time I'd ever heard the stat about Bangladesh. It's so important to keep the perspective that no matter how impacted we feel in the US, and especially in wealthy and progressive CA, we are causing the problem. Imagine how people in developing nations feel when their natural disasters leave them homeless or injures them. The United States led the way into the climate crisis, and it's our responsibility to lead the world out of it with the Green New Deal.



<br><hr>

After reading your comment, I felt shocked that we have never thought about the cost that we used during and after a disaster. People always think about that the disaster would only cause a little damage; however, it would could a serious effects not only on our environments, but also on our economics even the whole nation. Take the wildfire for example, California has been gone through thousand times of wildfire. Every time when this disaster happened, people have to evacuate to other places for save, their houses have been damaged, which their property has all been damaged. Not only that, but also government have to put a lot of money to rebuild their home. With the wildfire which emitted tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, the temperature would rise which would also cause other places to have some relative effects such as the sea level rises, and temperature in the pole become higher. Many negative influences would affect on our life. So, I think people now could come up some solutions to prevent this bad situation happen because I think this way would be more effective than solve the problem after or during it happen.



<br><hr>

Yea, the costs of battling fires is never really thought of other than rebuilding after but it takes so many resources in order to stop fires. The fires are already so damaging in a country like the US where we have the resources and the manpower to battle it, it's hard to imagine if this area was not so rich, these fires would have been many more times as devastating as they already were. It's an example of how the developed countries have used fossil fuels to build up their economy so that they can be better prepared for the consequences of it. But other countries that are still starting to develop are not as fortunate as us and not much can be done to stop these fires and other disasters.


<br><hr>
I agree with your last statement. We have the resources to combat the effects of climate change but many countries do not. The United States should take responsibility as a world leader. As a country, our government does not even acknowledge that we are responsible for the majority of the greenhouse gases in the world. We are responsible for the suffering of people in other countries and its about time we acknowledged that. We also have the money and resources to offer help to these countries. The Green New Deal is a step forward for the United States if we manage to get it passed, however we need to address the damage we’ve done to the rest of the world. Countries like Bangladesh do not have funds for fighting a huge fire or preventing flooding. Especially as a coastal country, they will be affected by sea level rise and flooding. These are climate change affects that will not reach us in the US. The consequences of our lifestyle and our choices are being put on other countries around the world. That's really messed up if you ask me. As a country we don’t take responsibility for anything we do. This needs to change.

I completely understand where you are coming from and relate as well. I too have lived in the valley my entire life and fire season always came around every year during August through October. I was used to the fires and the firefighters coming up and putting the fires out. I myself have had to evacuate a couple of times as well and feared that my home could possibly be burned down. Thankfully that didn't happen only because we had firefighters. I never once thought before how much it was to fight a fire until Ken had said it. We are truly luck to live in a country that has enough money to do things like fight fires and protect our homes. A fire like the ones from back may destroy a few homes but in places like Bangladesh they would not be so fortunate.



<br><hr>
Not to be condescending but your comment on saying that you didn't think fires cost anything just made me laugh. I just wanted to point out the fact the 'costs' that we mostly talk about when talking about environmental implications of fires caused by climate change are material, monetary, as well as physical implications. A small fire outside your house, even without the need for the assistance of firefighters, are still costing you indirectly. The greenhouse gases that are released in the atmosphere when something is burned is costing you as it contributes in the unprecedented amount of CO2 released in the atmosphere. 
  <br><br>
'Time is Gold' - my father, who is a certified firefighter, always emphasized that in any transaction, I should always partially consider the value of my time. Time is money. My father, was one of the military personals  that got sent to towns in Santa Barbara county to prevent the damage of the fire from expanding its radius. My father drove a firetruck from LA to Ventura and didn't come back for more than 3 weeks. That's a lot of time not being able to see your family, while fighting a huge fire. 40 days. The Thomas fire lasted for 40 days. It was so bad, firefighters from other counties were urgently needed and the fire was still not contained quickly, because of it's aggressive expansion. Time is also money. Time put in by the people that lost their homes, even the people they loved. Years of generational wealth burned to ashes; people and possessions that are priceless and can never be replaced.

Yes indeed one of the products of living in a first world country at such a large scale as the United states is ignorance. It is absolutely absurd how little we are aware of the intensity and sheer volume of resources we have living here. It is mind boggling to even imagine the statistics that Ken mentioned when comparing ourselves to Bangladesh such as our 6600% larger meat intake per capita as well as our 21000% larger ownership of vehicles per capita compared to someone living in Bangladesh. This ignorance emerges from the large scale of our society and economy. We look around and we are surrounded by car dealerships and restaurants everywhere thus normalizing the amount of cards we own and the number of hamburgers we consume. Our society is practically too big in that it is oversupplying us with resources and having an absolute terrible effect on our climate. The amount of carbon our overproducing economy creates is absurd. The amount of energy it takes to build those restaurants and dealerships is large but it continues as it takes more energy to maintain them and keep them running. It is ridiculous how large weve grown and the only feasible way to help fight against this climate crisis is by degrowth.

  <br><br>

We need to shrink our production in order to lessen our carbon footprint as well as have a more consistent use of energy across the globe as long as the energy is renewable. Large countries such as us need to shrink and convert to eco friendly energy and developing countries should be helped by supporting them with resources to advance their country and have it grow through the use of sustainable energy. As a larger country with plentiful resources I feel as if it is our duty to help those who are still developing their countries in this day and age. High volume of sustainable energy needs to be in our very near future.

The “Green New Deal” reading we had this week was one that I actually had the chance to read last quarter in my world history class. I did reread it, though, to refresh my memory and I was able to understand it better. The issues that were explained and how the House of Reps would like to take action is a place to start. It’s amazing that politicians are aware that they need to start creating a solution to the climate crisis, but more needs to be done. They give good solutions to the problem and are able to find a way to keep the economy going even if the use of fossil fuels stops. This is only the first step though. Many politicians refuse to let this plan go through and this will make the climate crisis an even bigger problem than it already is.
   <br><br>
It is necessary to understand that many people, especially the President, do not agree with this plan. They think that it will not work and will cause the US economy to plummet. How are we able to even put such ideas into action if politicians won’t allow it?
  <br><br>
 As for this video, Ken talks about how the US has the resources to get out of disasters that the climate crisis has already caused. We have the means to be okay, even after towns burn down. How can we keep living comfortably and hurting the planet, when disasters happen in other countries as well. These other countries don’t have the money or resources to be okay after these disasters happen. Millions die and are left without homes. California has had numerous fires over the years and we have been able to bounce back from them. It is unjust that we are a part of the effect the climate crisis has on countries like Bangladesh and we keep neglecting that what we do takes a toll on millions of people.

I really agree with you and the awareness you are speaking off. It is easy to forget that by following this course we position ourselves in such a way that we do actually know a lot more about the climate crisis and the nuances of the matter compared to the average Joe. This being said we need to be aware that there are more interests at stake that are working against change in the political system (against change in general and against change on the subject matter climate crisis. 
  <br><br>
As for if America should be a front runner in helping other countries and being an example for other countries I don't think they should. In my opinion America has a lot of problems to solve before attending being a front runner in the climate crisis. Too much has to change still in terms of inequality and awareness before they can start to consider being a leading force in this matter. Although I admire the ambition in the Green New deal I do not yet think America is ready for such a radical change.
  <br><br>
On another note, there is no time. All countries need to act now. In particular America as a leading polluter. I think America should do everything in their power to help other countries survive the catastrophic consequences of the climate change whilst starting to try and change their own culture. A big task, but it needs to be done.
<br><hr>
I really resonated with what you said. The climate crisis is caused by humans so it comes down to humans to solve it. Unfortunately, us humans have a complicated political system that makes taking any sort of meaningful action easier said than done. For this reason, the climate crisis is inherently political and whether we like it or not, how we vote is one of the most powerful things we can do. It is so hard to conceptualize how these political figures who are leading our country firmly oppose the Green New Deal on grounds of corruption and lies. It can’t be about money anymore, as this is our earth dying, but unfortunately, money is deeply involved with the issue and its solutions. This ties to what Ken was saying in the video about America’s ability to combat the physical damages of the climate crisis with money, but many countries, such as Bangladesh, can not. This is why I think that many points of opposition to the Green New Deal and climate action in general have no grounds. They claim that the amount of money these steps would take is outrageous, unrealistic, and unnecessary. However, here we are having to spend vast amounts of money on reactionary emergency services to combat effects of this climate crisis. So, why not spend money at the source of the issue instead of using it in the aftermath, when lives are at stake. I also understand that this deal is only a first step, but it is a step in the right direction. 
  <br><br>
I was also just taken aback because I, shamefully, had never heard of the Green New Deal before taking this class. I knew who AOC was and I knew she was taking action but those three words really meant nothing to me and I had no idea how revolutionary it all is. It was so interesting to read the well written goals and objectives and see how this change could actually materialize with a little more momentum.



<br><hr>
I do agree with Yazmin, that a discussion must be made about how and why some people do not agree with the Green New Deal. Unlike Yazmin, I have never fully read the Green New Deal before this class. After reading this document, I found it nice that the document directly addresses the impact that the United States has made to global emissions. The document mentioned that the US has emitted 20% of global greenhouse gases through 2014, so we must take a leading role in reduction. Putting the blame back on the United States could make some Americans feel empathetic towards the situation. 
  <br><br>
Ken’s video discusses how Americans really like most of the things that cause global warming, including beef, money from oil, cars, and air travel. It is difficult to get all Americans to agree on a deal that causes them to cut down or stop using many things in life that bring them joy. It is especially hard, as Yazmin noted, for Americans to all get on board with a plan that even our own President doesn’t support.



<br><hr>

Hey Yazmin! Your last two lines were thoughts i exactly felt coming to the end of this video. Its disgusting as Americans we pride ourselves on being the global leader in this in that. We are the world biggest superpower; we are a great nation and so on and so forth. Like you, I believe it the ball is in our court to lead in something thats actually worth while and take charge in the fight against climate change. It shouldn't be done out of sense of pride and arrogance in that "we are America, we need to be the best!" With all we have contributed to climate change in the oodles of carbon emissions we've dumped into the atmosphere, it's our obligation to what is right in safeguarding this nation, and to an extent, the rest of the world.
  <br><br>

This brings me to my thoughts on the Green New Deal.  Watching those initial youtube videos providing an overview of the bill was really helpful, but i was surprised at the simplicity and conciseness of the bill: here are the problems we are facing as a nation, here is our duty on how we can fix them and how these solutions benefit all in the country. Often in this class I have had the thought of "climate change aside, what about the other injustices in our country and world, how can we fix them?" This is where the Green New Deal perfectly waltzes in! The Green New Deal, although just a first step and thought process, provides a bridge between most injustices in our country, and attempts to attack them through fighting climate change while building a better future. It was the first time that I felt hopeful and confident in both the political power of myself as well as politicians who are looking past material agendas.



<br><hr>

I have similar feelings as you do as to how can our climate crisis be mitigated if politicians don't agree on it. Although the emergence of Green New Deal is a good sign showing that politicians have started thinking about ways to mitigate the climate crisis. I also believe that certainly more is yet to be done, because after all, the Green New Deal is only a plan or proposal, but implementations are the key to real changes, which may involve some dramatic transformations in energy sources and lifestyles that can take time to be accepted. Knowing the current status of Green New Deal also let me realizes how individual actions alone are not enough and can be comparatively far less powerful if governmental efforts are not implemented. 
  <br><br>

I also appreciate the parts in Green New Deal about how the society and economy can be better off after the implementation of the Green New Deal, which can address some people's concern about the costs of environmental protection and sustainability. Another thought I have is that although I understand dramatic changes are needed, a more concrete and realistic plan may be needed to make the implementation easier. Nevertheless, I believe political support and appeal from the public are crucial to making the deal happen. 
  <br><br>

After watching Ken's video, I also felt mind-boggling about the severity of the problem of social and environmental injustice, which I didn't know is so drastic. Besides having pity for those who are unfortunate, I also feel that more help and opportunities should be offered to them to really make the world a better place but not just a country, or those who are wealthy. Specifically, I think education should be made more accessible and affordable to those poor ones, so they can have an opportunity to have a decent job and lead a decent life. Lastly, I also appreciate how Ken reflects on his privilege and how he is concerning about and fighting for those who don't have that privilege.



<br><hr>
I personally had never read the Green New Deal officially before.  I have heard of it, I even have supported it, without really knowing everything that was covered in the official documentation.  I agree that I am very proud of our congress for taking the action that they are, but there is of course so much more to be done. 
  <br><br>


As you mention however, many politicians deny the Green New Deal for a variety of reasons.  I often end up seeing people arguing against it without anything to back themselves up, or any specific part of the Deal that they dislike.  There is so much more to be done, the cause truly needs more support behind it from politicians themselves, which is why voting is so so important. 

  <br><br>

As Ken talks about climate justice, I find it very interesting.  Before this course, I hadn't considered climate justice, but it is such a relevant and important part of the overall discussion.  The comparison of meat consumption and flying rates in the United States as compared to Bangladesh is crazy to me.  An average american eats 6600% more meat than a person in Bangladesh.  As you say, it is incredibly unjust that we are impacting them through our actions, millions of people are experiencing the negative effects of our actions.  It's incredibly sad to me, and we as a country need to take better accountability for our actions, and make sure we are doing what we can to stop this from happening, and to help where it already has.




<br><hr>
I agree! We are likely to think we have already known a lot about climate change after taking this class. We will also pay more attention to climate issues and think in environment-friendly ways.  Climate change is caused by humans, and it is really hard for humans to realize the roots of the problem and solve them. I never heard of the Green New Deal before taking this class.  The document mentioned that the US has emitted 20% of global greenhouse gases through 2014. It means Americans should also be more responsible in solving environmental issues.




<br><hr>
I believe that it is unfortunate that there are politicians that are trying to come up with good solutions to help the climate crisis, but there are also many politicians out there that are stopping these plans from going through because of their personal interests. This is incredibly selfish of them, and super frustrating for everyone that is trying to do the right thing that would benefit the majority of people. 
  <br><br>
It is super unfortunate that when many people in the U.S. think about the climate crisis, they only tend to think about the situations in the U.S. They see how we have been able to come back and rebuild after natural disasters. But, we don’t really think about all the countries that do not have the resources that we have to come back from a big disaster. I agree that it is super unjust that we as a country take a big part in the climate crisis and the causes that it has on countries like Bangladesh where millions of people are hit hard and much worse in comparison to us in the U.S. If it is a problem that was created mainly by us, we should definitely be the frontrunner in trying to alleviate the situation.




<br><hr>

I was also thinking about the fact that there are other countries who are not as well off as the US in terms of financial power.As we live our lives comfortably, countries around the world are struggling because we are the ones sucking the life out of the earth and the other countries are paying for it. I definitely feel that we are not doing enough as a country to help contribute to the world in the most positive way and allow ourselves to find ways to solve the problem of excess emissions. We need to collectively work on a solution and a plan of action in order to better the Earth.



<br><hr>

You make a lot of really good points. I agree that while it’s comforting to know that there are politicians out there who care about the climate crisis, it’s only the first step. We’ve seen time and time again that there are still politicians chained to the willpower of businesses who would have to change their ways if actions like the Green New Deal were implemented, and that there are still politicians who flatout deny the severity of the climate crisis. The solutions proposed in the Green New Deal were extremely reasonable; I truly could not find anything proposed in the resolution that I didn’t agree with. No matter how easy it is to see the benefits, though, there are always going to be those who immediately protest anything related to helping the climate. Something that I struggle to understand is that even if the climate crisis wasn’t as severe as it is, why not help the environment anyways? Even if we didn’t have the consequences of climate change looming over our heads, why shouldn’t we want to help keep the planet healthy anyways? Just because we could inflict more damage, doesn’t mean we should.

<br><hr>

You are right, how can a country be changed if the politicians in this country do not agree to change the country. They are the most powerful people in the country and they are able to change the law and regulations, so if they do agree, there is no possibility to change. Well, about the green new deal, which caused a great disapproval from politicians, I understand why politicians take this action. Although scientists state that this new energy can also make the economy go even though we abandon fossil fuel. However, if we are going to abandon fossil fuel, this must hurt the benefits of some people, such as fuel companies. And this can cause a big influence on the economy. Also, for some countries who rely on fuel to make money, they would lose the only thing to earn money. So it is understandable that politicians do not agree with this new deal. Also, creating a green new deal needs a lot of money, this causes them more unwilling to put money in investigating this. But I do not think politicians should totally deny this green new deal, they might take a more gentle solution that gradually replace some fuel with green new deal and keep these two in the market. Because fuel does produce a great pollution to the earth, we should reduce its consumption. So creating a green new deal is necessary but replacing fuel totally is impossible. So I just hope the politicians could find a midpoint that can perfectly solve the problem between these two energy.

The "Green New Deal" had a huge responsibility to the rest of the world as it has to minimize these effects on the environments so that countries like Bangladesh aren't destroyed. Only the poor countries will feel the effects of the rich countries just like in every book and movie where the rich are care free and their actions disrupt life for the poor. People in America hate the rich where they see them as selfish and undeserving and only care about themselves, however they don't see they they do the exact same thing to others below them. The Green new deal is essential to the survival of the poor in other parts of the world and the future children of america. billions of dollar of destruction is a result of climate change which is a huge problem. Poverty in Bangladesh is so bad that the poor cannot do anything with the development around them and will take anything they can get. The green new deal is an important first step to prevent further damage to poor countries like Bangladesh.

I agree that in the Green New Deal they give good solutions to certain problems that won’t hurt the economy, but will do the opposite and help create jobs and grow the economy into something new. I know this is not a piece of legislature, but more a plan and a call to action for the United States government to change our way of living away from fossil fuels and towards renewables. In the Green New Deal, it explains very nicely how we should be using more green energy and fixing our public transportation systems. Something I do not necessarily agree with is that most politicians do not know or are trying to act like they aren’t aware that our country needs to change how we make and do things because they are serving the interests of oil companies. If it wasn’t for AOC and her partner on this piece then politicians could keep going on saying they have no idea how to successfully evolve the United States and its economy. Something that I know professor Hiltner has mentioned before in previous lectures is that currently the United States already pays billions of dollars after a natural disaster happens, but we could be using that taxpayer money into building great public transportation, education or switching our economy from fossil fuel-based into renewables. I also agree with you that many conservative politicians choose not to let any legislation related to the Green New Deal pass because they either do not understand or choose to ignore all the good it will do for the American people. The United States has the largest economy and we are also held the title of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, so we have an obligation to do something that will help the climate crisis and the Green New Deal is a step in the right direction, but many politicians are choosing to let poor countries feel the consequences for our actions. 
  <br><br>
Our country as a whole needs to embrace the Green New Deal because it is the future we need.

Once again, we learn about how drastically our actions, namely the whole country of the United States, have had on the environment. I am always surprised by the large numbers, though I shouldn’t be at this point, as it has been repeated over and over again how much more we contribute to global greenhouse emissions than most other poorer countries with smaller populations. This upsets me, because as a large country, we have so much more potential to do good, and while we are enjoying luxuries and contributing the most to the climate crisis, other poorer countries are suffering because of it. We need to start taking a greater initiative in creating a greener environment. With great power comes great responsibility, and I would say that certainly applies in this situation. 
   <br><br>
I believe the Green New Deal could be our first big step towards change. However, if we don’t take action on it or if we can’t ever pass it, nothing will change. This is why it is so important that young people like us take political action. If none of us vote or voice our opinions politically, no action will ever be taken by the government to stop the climate crisis. I know many people are not big fans of politics, I am one of those people. I dislike the senseless arguments and conflicts that come with it. However, it is completely necessary that we become involved politically before it’s too late. As the younger generation, we must take control and let people know what we believe in to make a change.

It’s truly disappointing every time we learn how much of a culprit the U.S. is in polluting our environment. It’s sad that this is the case because so many countries are susceptible to following the U.S’s lead. When they see us carelessly releasing 25% of the total global emissions, it doesn’t set a very good example; especially if the goal is to change our habits in order to keep warming below 2 degrees celsius. I agree with you that we need to take initiative in moving towards a greener environment and economy. As a country that’s such a large economic powerhouse, we have the means to shift towards greener practices, so why haven’t we? I believe the answer to that lies in our government’s inability to come to a consensus on what needs to be done. Hearing that the Trump administration cut funding to Bangladesh to two-third its original size wasn’t at all surprising. By voting people like him and his party members into office, we’re practically signing away the fate of our planet to people who don’t even believe global warming is real. Does this terrify anyone else, or is it just me? This is why I think your point about voting and voicing our opinions is so important. In order to get the right people into office, we have to elect them to be there. Our generation could have so much force on the decision of who’s in office if we all exercised our right to vote, but sadly that’s not what’s being done.      
  <br><br>
I believe that we bare an enormous responsibility to not only do better for our environment but also to help those in less-developed countries recover from climate caused disasters that we have practically put into motion. The disproportionate emissions between developed and developing countries show the direct link that we have in causing climate change. Sitting back and allowing millions of people in countries like Bangladesh to suffer from climate caused disasters is no longer acceptable. Many people stubbornly stick to the idea of letting those countries handle it themselves, but we all know that isn’t possible. With 40% of people in Bangladesh falling into the labels of being hungry, starving, and/or chronically hungry, it’s undeniable that we have economic power and advanced development that they don’t have. Rather than being selfish and watching other countries suffer, we should assume our role in helping those countries fight the destruction that we, the U.S., is causing. I’m not exactly sure what actions we can take to help, but I know what we shouldn’t do is cut our funding to them.

I do agree with you on the part that the Green New Deal is going to be a BIG step towards change. Ideally, I would hope for our country to go under massive changes to fix the climate crisis in time. Yet, I do see the potential problem with carrying through the Green New Deal; it's going to be a massive systematic change, one of which will drastically change the lives of many Americans. For us, I can see that change to be less of a burden, since it would shift the wats of how we eat or travel, etc. For others, their job will be lost and will have to switch to the federally funded jobs as a replacement. I worry that many of these people may be underemployed, while companies in the renewable industry get more income. I know that the Green New Deal touches on that specific issue (of the top 1% having more money than the rest of the world), but will the change be enough to reduce the power of the rich?

I agree with you on the fact that these large numbers in comparison to the numbers from Bangladesh are disgusting especially when considering how much more technological advancements and money we have. Our country is one of the perfect countries to change over toward a greener lifestyle that would be helping us as well as our fellow neighbors around the world. When I was reading the Green New Deal, I noticed that many of these conditions seemed reasonable and highly achievable. It made no sense as to why we have not gotten to any of these changes in the past decade because other countries, like Japan, were able to create some of these things before we could think of them as an option. For example, if we were to have high-speed rails similar to the ones in Japan, we could eliminate the need for some plane rides and commute to jobs more efficiently while also helping our planet. The only part that would be a big problem is the building of these high-speed trains since it would create a huge sum of CO2 to be able to get to a point where it would be worth it for our country and for the planet as a whole. The Green New Deal is not perfect but I believe it is the step the US needs to take if we want to get on the right track for our planet. However, as you said “…if we don’t take action on it or if we can’t ever pass it, nothing will change” and it’s absolutely right. It’s similar to Newton’s laws in the fact that if we are on this path of destroying our planet and ecosystem we will stay this way UNLESS we have a great enough force, such as passing the Green New Deal, that will get us off the path finally and onto a path that will be better. If we put the word out about which candidates are campaigning to help our situation, maybe we can finally receive the voice that we have needed to get us our of our planet-destroying rut. So please vote if you can.

Hey, Ashley! I agree with you wholeheartedly. The Green New Deal’s implementation would cause an era of opportunity for the improvement in how we live our day-to-day lives, how the top politicians and companies will act to cease climate change, and how society views the climate crisis. By bringing this issue to the table while also keeping America’s vastly dissimilar political views in mind, this draws forth the conclusion that the climate crisis is, and has been for many years, a political issue.

  <br><br>

No matter how boring I think politics (usually) are, this will be the first year that I am legally allowed to vote. That means that I will, without a question, be taking part in the upcoming election. In conclusion, I agree with your take on how we can influence the government through political actions. As the younger generation, we must vote in order to allow our voices to be heard this year by the “puppetmasters” of our country.



<br><Hr>

You propose a good point about America’s responsibility in the environmental conversation. As a nation, we obviously take the lead in many regards and sort of paint the picture for other countries and societies. It’s negligent of our government to look at climate disaster in the face and refuse to take proper action. I used to be one of those people that “wasn’t political” and felt that my single vote was irrelevant, but as I learn and grow I realize that climate change is everyone’s problem and regardless of what our system says, we must find a way to enact change and do the best we can.




<br><Hr>

I totally agree with what you’re saying, and I feel the same way. When I hear these numbers that Ken states in all of these videos, I’m shocked at first. Per capita, automobile ownership in the US is 21,000 percent greater than in Bangladesh? That’s insane! But, then I stop and think -- why am I even surprised? These numbers are the harsh reality that make up our world today. The US is one of the most powerful nations in the world, and we are capable of influencing so many other countries. However, we are not using our power to help our environment; we’re using our power to hurt the environment as well as developing countries all over the world.
  <br><br>


The Green New Deal is a very important step in the right direction. If you listen to the current presidential debates, many Democratic candidates are talking about their plans to deal with the climate crisis. Like you said, it’s important for our generation to exercise our right to vote and put someone who cares about our environment into office. The power is in our hands, and we need to take control.




<br><Hr>


Something in your comment that really jumped out to me was when you stated that “we (the U.S.) have so much more potential to do good”. I agree that this is what makes our position, or rather lack thereof, in the climate crisis so frustrating. We have the money, we have the brainpower, we have the supplies, now all we need is a plan to save the world and a government willing to go through with it. There could come a point when wealth and status are no match for the effects of climate change, and if that point comes, we (the U.S.) want to be able to say we at least tried to do something to stop worldwide devastation and didn’t sit on our arses while everything fell apart around us. 
  <br><br>
You are totally right: the Green New Deal is the first step towards change, but change won’t and can’t come until this bill is passed and set in motion. Most young people (myself included) are quite vocal about how unhappy they are with our current administration and disappointed with how it fails to do anything about the climate crisis. It is absolutely imperative that in this next election, we make these opinions heard and that we demand and vote into office an administration that takes environmental issues seriously and is willing to enact laws that prevent further ecological destruction.



<br><Hr>


I agree with this comment completely, in order to create the change we as a generation must vote and try to educate the older generations of this issue. The great social injustices that come hand in hand with the climate and environmental issue should be acted upon also. The Green New Deal only mentions protecting and helping American citizens but what about the unfortunate developing countries dealing with the bulk of all the injustices? America's consumerism and our reckless buying and consumerism have driven to deaths and poor health of these developing countries which have no choice but to accept it. Thus, I feel that along with creating change in the US the government should assist these other countries to develop sustainably. This could be done through lending money and technology, this would, in turn, create more expensive prices for our purchases but the treatment of these humans should be more important. Voting and activism for the climate and these countries are essential to solving this issue.



<br><Hr>
I completely agree with you. It seems as if the actions we need to take are large-scale, but I would simply say that this is the result of the large-scale damage we have done to contribute to the negative effects of the climate crisis. This upsetting fact is exemplified by Ken’s statistics that compare Bangladesh’s and the U.S.’s carbon footprint. As Ken explains, climate change is exacerbated by so-called first world problems that are paid for by the developing world, and, in order to mitigate this issue, the developed world must begin to use far less energy while the developing world must learn to raise the quality of life for its people and use more energy more responsibly and sustainably. 
  <br><br>


By reading through the goals of the Green New Deal, we can see that this plan takes an emphasis on addressing climate change through the lends of social justice, especially on achieving equality in the access to clean air and water and building climate resilient communities. Although I have heard a lot about the Green New Deal, I had never read the document myself, and, after doing so, it seems as if no plan before had been more comprehensive in terms of explaining the consequences of a warming planet in our own country as well as the goals that need to be met to mitigate these consequences. To argue against action is to ignore, probably most importantly, the social consequences of climate change on the most vulnerable in our own communities.





<br><Hr>

I, too, was shocked every time, repeatedly by those large numbers of how many negative contributions that we are forcing on our environment. I, too, felt absolutely heartbroken to learn that those consequences are mostly suffered by a large proportion of the poor and innocent population. The Green New Deal, as I believe, is a significantly good start of the first step that the United States might raise awareness as a country. I strongly agree that it is super important for young people to engage in such causes, especially those political actions, to support the protection of the environment. If the Green New Deal will be successfully adopted, implemented and enforced, no doubt there be will a great change in solving the problems at the root. For example, it mentions many specific challenges such as the loss of jobs, the rise of poverty, famine, and diseases, as well as the uneven distribution of wealth and monetary resources. It would be, and it should be, a solid first step that the country is looking for. As an influential country in the world, the United States should definitely devote its power to being a role model in this case, for the rest of the world.




<br><Hr>
I agree, the United States is so wealthy compared to many countries yet takes no action in combatting the climate crisis. We experience so much privilege to be able to live in air-conditioned spaces, drink clean water, and fight against large fires. This isolates us from the problems that our luxurious living is causing. These effects are all pushed onto the poorer nations and communities. 
  <br><br>
This emphasizes the intersectionality of the climate crisis issue. Combating climate change is not only a movement towards saving the planet, but also a movement toward bettering the lives of those in poverty, women, minorities, and other oppressed groups. Mobilizing against one issue helps push against other issues too. For example, improving education access and quality for women helps to mitigate climate change as well as improve the status and living condition of many women. Improving public transportation will lower carbon emissions and improve the mobility of those who cannot afford cars.
  <br><br>
The Green New Deal touches upon this intersectionality. It sees this fight against climate change as an opportunity to “counteract systemic injustices.” Ocasio-Cortez sees not only the environmental benefits of pushing forward this resolution, but also the social and economic benefits as well. By taking steps toward saving the environment, we also elevate the quality of life for many people in many different facets.





<br><Hr>


I completely agree with what you're saying here. The US dumps greenhouse gas into the environment with very little negative effects on our own lives, while lives around the world are heavily affected. Just because we don't necessarily see what we're doing doesn't make it not real, let alone okay. We are so advanced in the US that it makes logical sense that rather than outputting far more than what we should be, we could easily be using our technology in finding ways to stop the climate crisis. Though we're a young country, we have an immense amount of power, and it could be used for bettering the planet, but instead we're just too selfish to give up our luxurious way of life. 
  <br><br>


The Green New Deal definitely seems like a step in the right direction, and one I'm happy to put my vote behind. The young generation seems to be fired up about voting and letting our voice be heard, but it's more so due to the president we currently have in office, and less so about deals like this that will help us to have more of a future. The older generation honestly put us in a bad spot, and now it's up to us to fix their mistakes for our own future. That alone should be enough to get everyone out voting, but it's not just about president, though that is a hugely important election, but it's about voting for the small things as well. We all need to make sure we're educated in what we're behind so that the next generation isn't having to fight as hard as we need to be fighting right now.

Hi! I also still seem to have the same reactions every time about the large numbers. I know I shouldn't really be surprised anymore after so many of the things we have already learned in this class but I still find myself frustrated and shocked that these things are happening. With that said, like you, I believe that after reading the Green New Deal that it could be our first big step to taking large action on climate change. In order for this change to happen, you are right we need to be politically involved especially as the younger generation that will have to live through all of this.



<br><Hr>


Just like you, I am still surprised by these large numbers, even though I shouldn’t be at this point. Maybe it’s because I don’t see myself properly represented with these numbers, but I know there are those in this country that bump these numbers up. It is upsetting that we have all the power to reverse this problem and we are not doing anything, but yet again, we have this power and all these resources due to our exploitation of our planet. 
   <br><br>
The “Green New Deal” would definitely do a lot to combat climate change and a lot for this country. It is a great plan that addresses and ties together social justice, environmental, and climate justice. It would definitely make us a “green” country, but it would do much more than that. It would show the world that becoming green is possible and must be done. Not only should we lead by example, but we should also assist all these other countries that need more energy and resources to get these things with ways that would not harm the planet. As you said, we must all take voting seriously and encourage as many people as we can to vote for the right people that will allow things such as the Green New Deal to be put into effect.




<br><Hr>
Hi Ashley, I can't agree more with your point that as the younger generation, we must take action immediately to deal with this climate crisis and encourage people around us to pay attention to climate change and make their actions. In order to mitigate climate change, personal actions are not nearly enough, and we need to collectively address this problem. Undoubtedly, climate change is a global issue, but different countries have their own individual challenges with respect to this issue. In developed countries like the United States, the challenge is to change the lifestyles which produce massive Carbon Dioxide. Ken mentioned the term "degrowth" which argues the US should enter a period of degrowth where people are seeking a meaningful life while reducing the economy and population. On the contrary, in developing countries, the challenge is to raise the quality of life for everyone. Due to this situation, the Paris agreement left the decisions to individual countries. Each country will set their goal of reducing how much C02 and try their best to meet that goal. We have talked about the US has been responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions, having emitted 20 percent of global greenhouse gas through 2014, so I believe the US has to take a leading role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Ken also talked about social justice, climate justice, and environmental justice. To sum up, poor people have to suffer more from climate change even though they are not responsible for causing the problem. We as the younger generation with the knowledge we acquired need to do more to save our planet. Taking personal action is not enough, we have to take political action which can make a bigger influence on other people's behavior.





<br><Hr>


I agree with you. Politics play a huge role in today's battle against climate change, and there seems no way out of it, unfortunately. Before, I had hope that people would be honest and actually smart enough to care for the planet, because for now, it is the only home we got. But not long ago I realized that this is not the right way of thinking. People will always act in their interests and capitalize on the opportunities arisen not even having a thought about the consequences that their actions have on others. This is the world we live in now, and there is little we can do about it. What we can do, however, is, as you mentioned, take control and let people know what we believe in. I think it is very crucial for our generation to be heard, because the future of this planet is in our hands, and if we do not do enough right now, our inaction will lead to terrible consequences that nobody wants. We should all vote and spread the information we know as much as we can.



<br><Hr>

I was also read it with mixed emotions. I was first surprised by the numbers as you mentioned, which was extremely shocking and truly put into scale how dire the situation is. This then led to me being angered and upset about not only how we have failed as a country in continuing down this destructive path, but also how grim the future seems as there are so many uneducated people who would immediately dismiss this document as "anti-American". But after thinking about it a little longer, it led me to finally experience hope, because it although it took a long time, we are now finally taking saving the planet seriously. With more and more efforts being taken to raise awareness for the environment, the uneducated are now becoming educated and taking front and center in this fight for our future. I'm extremely excited and optimistic for our future and the oncoming of change!

Hi Ashley, I agree that now is the time for the younger generation to take action. The Green New Deal was very well thought out and is actually here to make a change to the planet. A lot of politicians and people talk about climate change as a problem, but this is one of the first times I’ve seen serious action being taken to reverse the issue. The Green New Deal maps out our future. I like that it addresses the problem we are facing and what will happen if we don’t act. It contains a section on the exact costs of a 2 degrees rise in temperatures. This should drive us to follow the Green New Deal. It also gives us a deadline, wherein we need to cut our emissions in half by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2050.  Also, it also looks to address economic inequality, a problem that has been worsening in the US. I agree with you that we need to vote, we need to take action because we need to demand that opportunities like these become a reality. I agree with you that the Green New Deal is the first step to true change. What sucks is that I often see Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez get a lot of hate for small and peculiar things. People shouldn’t judge her before they get to know her as a politician. This bill, if read with an open mind, I believe could change a lot of people's minds on Cortez and on their opinions of climate change. Saying you agree with the science of climate change isn’t good enough anymore. The fight has begun, we need to start acting to make actual change. I agree with you Ashely, activism, voting, and expressing your voice are all vital to becoming carbon neutral and saving the planet. Despite the resistance from many people, and the toughness of giving up some aspects of our culture, I believe we aren’t doomed. Like Ken explained in his lecture, The climate crisis will impact developing nations the fastest and the most. His example of Bangladesh completely puts our privilege into perspective. We can’t just solve this issue at the last minute after it has become completely unbearable. We need to fight for this to happen before it harms the developing world because that's our moral obligation.




<br><Hr>
I feel the same way as you about the amount the United States contributes to global greenhouse emissions. It's truly disappointing how polluting we are and how many people are oblivious or do not care about that fact. Because of our consumerist and wasteful culture, poorer countries are suffering heavily for our lifestyle choices. It's not fair for citizens countries like Bangladesh to lose their homes because some selfish people in a country thousands of miles away are enjoying luxuries like private air travel. I agree that we do need to take a greater initiative to create a more sustainable environment. I greatly appreciate the House of Representatives for proposing something as polarizing as the Green New Deal because it shows that we are moving in the right direction. However, it's greatly disappointing that the Senate blocked the passing of the Green New Deal bill. I agree with you that we, as the younger generation, need to take control and VOTE people in to help pass legislation like the Green New Deal in order to ensure a future for our environment.





<br><Hr>
I agree, many people do not particularly like politics, however it is important that the younger generation gets involved. The older generations have shown that they are not very motivated to act on climate change, so we must force a change. The Green New Deal lays out a comprehensive set of ideas that can drastically change the trajectory of the planet. As one of the largest producers of greenhouse gases, we have a responsibility to the rest of the world to lower our emissions. The Green New Deal, if the ideas were enacted, could drastically change the future of our country and the planet.





<br><Hr>

I also find it disheartening to be reminded of the profound impact that we have on the global population. It is quite difficult to conceptualize how we consume thousands of percentage more than people in developing countries like Bangladesh. Environmental injustice is an extremely important concept and perhaps one of the most pressing issues of our time. We are unfortunately standing idle as a country while we are seeing some of the most terrible environmental justice issues taking place around the world. I think it becomes a big question of "how do we sleep at night" knowing that as a country and a culture we are perhaps the worst perpetrators of human rights in recent history. It is ironic that many people view the US as the "hero"/ "protector" of the world, when in reality we are quite the opposite.




<br><Hr>

I definitely agree with you, every time I watch one of Ken’s videos that provide statistics and information on the damage our country is causing to the planet, I get more and more resentful. Like you said, we have so much potential to make a difference. America likes to brand itself as the world’s savior or superhero, yet when it comes to the biggest crisis of all, not only does it turn a blind eye, America turns out to be the biggest perpetrator. 
   <br><br>
The Green New Deal definitely will help progress our way in fighting climate change but if we are not even in the Paris agreement right now due to Trump, it makes everything seem a lot more hopeless. I hope we can change the political landscape quickly before it is too late.



<br><Hr>
I agree with you 100%. Even being an ES major for 3 years, I still find myself in awe at the raw data and how much the US contributes to greenhouse gases and pollution. However, reading the Green New Deal I was surprised at how much it covered. It really said what needed to be done and what the issues were very concisely. On top of this I was really glad to see that the green new deal included talk about the social impacts that come with environmental injustices. Not only this, but the mention that a majority of such cases usually occur to those of lower income was a great addition. While I have heard of the green new deal before and what purpose it served, this was my first time reading through it myself and I am very satisfied with it. I believe if a green new deal was implemented, it would definitely not pass without opposition, but if it did. This could easily mark the turning point of the US damaging the environment the way that we do.





<br><Hr>

I feel very similar to you Ashley regarding politics. I am not a big fan whatsoever because most of the times everything devolves into pointless bickering and gridlock. As a whole generation, however, we have the power to influence more than we realize, I believe. We can turn the pointless back and forth of politics into productive action. While I believe the Green New Deal could use a bit of touching up, if we push for this and stress climate crisis as the issue that it is, we could easily see comprehensive reform. I think the best way to do this would be by banning together as a generation and showing our value in this issue. I think it would help to possibly sacrifice a few of the proposals within the deal to better have a chance at swaying the opposition of the current proposition, possibly dropping some parts of the deal that weren't related to renewable energies, new technology, and promoting sustainability. We can reverse this status we have in America of over consumption and our passion to waste if we take these actions and get behind comprehensive reform of how we are dealing with the climate crisis.

I enjoy the quote that "With great power comes great responsibility" U.S is the number one power in the world in almost all the areas, however, U.S is not doing enough for the world. Especially on the question of global warming which was largely cost by developed countries especially U.S. It is sad to hear all these numbers that we waste so much food in the U.S and do not care at all. It becomes a lifestyle whereas a lot of people are starving. Just like you said, the green deal is our first step, but it is not enough at all, instead it is far from enough. It is not only the government's responsibilities to take actions, it is also our responsibilities to make changes and take actions. Voting, sharing our opinions and get more involved in the politics are all the steps that we can do. Even all the small steps will be helpful. It is always better that we are doing little than we are not doing anything. Although we are still young, we will eventually get into the seats later on. We can also use young generations as the method to communicate and educating the older generations to make better movements and changes.

After reading the "Green New Deal" I was also disappointed in the United States. We are the leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, yet we have a much smaller population than other areas in the world that emit much less. The individual carbon footprint in the United States is much higher than anywhere else in the world. This needs to change immediately and we need to take responsibility of our power like you said. The US enjoys luxuries and amenities  at the expense of the environment. We have the most wealth which has resulted in the worst environmental effects. The New Green Deal is a risky policy that could potentially play a huge role in the future of our planet. We must first pass this deal if we want to see the policy implemented, which could take awhile. In order to do so, we need to continue to elect democrats who are advocates for the policy. Our environments future lies in the hands on the government and its officials at the end of the day. The numbers and statistics surrounding the climate crisis are alarming and growing at unhealthy rates. If we want to prevent tragic natural disasters from happening in the future we must act immediatley and pass the green new deal.

Your point about the Green New Deal is very well made, and I agree that it's so important for young people to engage - sometimes sort of "barge in" if necessary - in the political process. From what I have experienced, virtually every executive board in every party, every corporation and every non-profit organization is dominated by members aged 50+. Although this is obviously not dismissing all of their policies and decision-making as invalid, there does exist a high chance that the concerns of the youth will not be heard or properly considered, unless someone who cares about the next generation's future (like) Ken steps in and takes action. Only when young people participate extensively in the political process - in other words, voter participation and political involvement must increase significantly - do we have a real shot at toppling injustice and rewriting legislation that achieves the radical objectives listed in the Green New Deal. We must take control of our future and fight without fear!

This comment and the facts provided by this video also resonated with me for personal reasons. The first time I was ever personally effected by a fire was during the Thomas Fire. I remember that so many UCSB students were very worried about how the fire would impact their health considering that the air quality was no longer healthy for people to breathe. The school would send emergency notices clarifying the safety precautions that had been made to protect the school and its students. Although the fire was in close proximity, I was never concerned about whether or not our school and the surrounding areas would be protected by firefighters. 
   <br><br>
My second personal experience with fires happened at the end of 2019 with the fires occurring in the San Fernando Valley. I remember checking the emergency maps about the fires and seeing that my hope boarded the evacuation areas. I remember hearing from friends that that their families were  being evacuated to other areas of Los Angeles. Experiencing a fire in my own town was a difficult experience, but yet again I was never concerned about the resources, because I knew that the fire department was ready to respond to whatever was necessary. 
   <br><br>
After watching this video, I realized how ignorant I had been about how many people do not have access to fire protection. Preventing wild fires does not only entail protecting nature from being burned down- fire prevention is completely necessary to ensure that communities do not suffer from the loss of economic stability, wildlife, and human life.

 I too was surprised by the enormous numbers Ken discussed. Hearing 660%, 14,000%, and a massive 21,000% as statistics comparing the United States to Bangladesh baffled me. I know this should be old news by week seven of this class, but every time I hear Ken mention facts like these or read about them it genuinely confuses me how we can live so obliviously while destroying our planet, and at the cost of developing countries. Reading the Green New Deal was interesting, but it was all about the United States. Yes, we need to start a change, but we also need to focus our resources to the countries who need it the most, and don’t have the funding or availability to fend for themselves due to our consumerism. 
   <br><br>
I really appreciate how you tied in our generation’s need to vote. This is such an important step toward making the United States more eco-friendly and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. I hope everything in the Green New Deal gets implemented, but at this rate it sadly doesn’t look like it will.





<br><Hr>

You are completley right, the United States is responsible for so much of the greenhouse emissions, but where I think we are most responsible - and failing to be responsible - is with our voice. The United States is truly one of the worlds leaders, and with this voice we have chosen to show that we are a country that pulls out of amazing agreements like the Paris Agreement. What I can only hope is that we choose to use this voice for the better in the coming elections. We finally have an opportuinity to vote people into power who have a hopeful view on the climate crisis and a plan to begin solving it. 
   <br><br>

I think if such a large and influentual country begins to make such large changes then a sort of climate revolution could start. I think that a lot of countries could be inspired by what we can do as such a large country if only we pooled our resources for the greater good, to combat this climate crisis. 
   <br><br>

I have often heard the argument, “but China emits more than we do.” But this does not matter. Simply becuase China hasn’t already uprooted their economy, doesn’t mean that we can’t be the first and spark this change. The time is now to make the differences we need.

I do agree with you that the Green New Deal will be a major step towards change. The "Green New Deal" we read this week. It refreshes my memory and I can understand it better. I think the bill is very powerful because it discusses the climate crisis, poverty and inequality. The issues explained and how the House of Representatives acted were a starting point. Amazingly, politicians realize they need to start working on a solution to the climate crisis, but more needs to be done. Many politicians have refused to pass the plan, which will make the climate crisis a bigger problem than it is now. It is necessary to understand that many people, especially the President, do not agree with this plan. They think this will not work and will cause the US economy to plummet. However, it is difficult to obtain longer-term benefits and sustainable development without giving up short-term benefits. With the Green New Deal, this will ultimately take us out of the woods and onto a better path. If we say which candidates are running to help improve our situation.

It is always motivating to hear other young people like me understand the importance of voting for people that they believe in to make the changes that they want to see. If only every American would have this same mindset. 
   <br><br>


When reading the Green New Deal, I first noticed how simple a read this was and I do think that AOC and Senator Markey wrote it in a way that all ages could read it. This makes for almost an incentive to keep reading the document for young, old, or even challenged readers. This is an overlooked tactic used by these writers to allow anyone and everyone to read this important piece of propaganda to push out the agenda of the Democrats.

One part that stood out to me was that it was the Federal Government's duty to "achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers." I want this to be true. However, it seems so very ambitious. How can we truly get to zero greenhouse gas emissions in a period of 30 years with a fair and just transition? How is that even possible? Transportation, electricity production, commercial and residential, agriculture, land use, and forestry. Unfortunately, everything we do today in any field emits harmful greenhouse gases. How the hell can cutting these to zero with the loss of millions of jobs be a smooth transition? It is not fair in any way. Cutting jobs will cut healthcare and lead to missed payments and the housing market will go to garbage because no one can afford anything anymore.

The United States has done so much damage to the world. However we have the power to set things straight. I agree we need to enact something like the green new deal. The damage that we have done is disproportionally hurts poor communities and communities of color. Often time there here in our own country but also many times they are around the world like Bangladesh. Let’s make our voices heard by voting on March 3rd and on Election Day in November. We have the power to enact change through the ballot box let’s use it.

I agree that the United States has been falling extremely short of what we need to do as a global economic leader, and I think that the Green New Deal is the US's attempt to take some responsibility and play a greater role in fixing the problems we have created. Getting to net zero emissions by 2050 would be an amazing feat; however, I think that the Green New Deal does not completely lay out how we can get there, which can make it hard for people to understand. The document discusses the costs of things like damages if the temperature does rise by over 2 degrees Celsius, but it does not really cover how much it would cost to reach net zero emissions. This is something people have criticized about the Green New Deal because it would cost billions or trillions, and even though this cost would eventually be worth it, it would take many years.
   <br><br>

Furthermore, I read that when the Green New Deal was initially released, the team accidentally released an unfinished version, causing a lot of confusion. With an issue as crucial and pressing as this, everything needs to be more clearly explained or else the critics will quickly be able to dismantle it. 
   <br><br>

I think the Green New Deal did do a good job of accepting that the US needs to put a stop to the injustice related to climate change both in the US and in other countries. Many people's quality of life is being affected and impaired by climate change, and as we have previously discussed, it is the impoverished feeling the effects of the wealthy's mistakes. The Green New Deal goes over the need for "economic transformation", which will be very important in fighting the climate crisis because it needs to be done in a way that will create economic growth and jobs.

In this article "The Green New Deal", the author have talked about the following several aspects: the consequences of global warming at or above 2 degrees Celsius beyond pre-industrialized levels , related crises that the United States is currently experiencing, and a lot of  methods to actually make a change against climate change. Through this article, I do know more about things that influence our carbon emissions in our daily life like we should upgrade existing buildings and build new buildings with higher energy consuming efficiency. And from my point of view, this "Green New Deal" is worthy to conduct because it is so detailed and it came up with many ways which we may not think about before. If I am one of the voters, I would definitely support this bill and if I am one of those executants I would try to implement suggested things.



<br><Hr>
I agree with a lot of what you said. It amazes me to see in numbers the level of damage we in the US cause compres to poorer counter. Being the wealthy and technologically advanced country that we are, we should take initiative to move to a greener and more sustainable lifestyle. (Not just because we have the means to do so, but the fact the climate crisis is, for the most part, causes by the US.) Knowing that changing out lifestyles can make a significant impact in mitigating the climate crisis should motivate us to not only make day to day changes, but to take political action as well. I’m not a very political person either, as it all seems intricate and confusing, but I do agree that voting is important and necessary to bring about systemic change, which is what we need now.





<br><Hr>
The irresponsibility of the large country upsets me too. It's so disappointed to know the truth that the large country especially U.S. contribute the most to the climate crisis, but it's some developing countries taking the consequences of Carbon emission. Instead of taking the consequences or taking actions, most people in large countries still enjoying a luxury life and playing the role of consumerism. I never realized the horrible environmental problem and disasters the people in the third countries suffering from is mostly caused by developed country like U.S.. I used to think the reason to be the lack of the consciousness of residences and technology in the developing country. But this reading proved me wrong. I agree with your idea that "large country have so much potential to do better as they have the ability. They own advanced technology,  sufficient finance, and they even have plan already like the Green New Deal. One of the problems is that there are still many contradictions which lead to the lack of mobility. 

   <br><br>

This leads to my agreement on the voting action. I never pay much attention on political issue but it's true that participating in political action can somewhat help the government taking actions to stop climate change before it's too late. And i believe that most people hold consensus on the environmental issue.

Reading “The Green New Deal” I felt like I was reading the future in a sense. I was honestly really surprised and disappointed with myself simultaneously about the fact that I had never heard about this deal before. Possibly this is because I did not live in the US but I feel like a deal this important and this revolutionary should have made every headline, should have been broadcasted by every single news outlet around the world. This is because finally someone or some organization was standing up and instead of just simply educating people about the prospect of climate change they have actually constructed a provisional plan to achieve this. Yes, some may see it as drastic and irrational, but the way I see it is as the revolutionary change that it doable, achievable, realistic and SMART and something that can really truly affect our planet for the better. 
   <br><br>


There were a few things I liked about “The Green New Deal.” Firstly, the fact that it was not solely focused on the betterment of the 1 percenters, or the richest and most powerful people in society. It was actually focusing more on empowering people in the lower communities and making sure that throughout this process of making America more sustainable, they would not be affected in adverse ways, rather they would be impacted positively by all of this. In fact, I envision that the wide inequality in wealth in America will decrease and become more equal between the richest and poorest in the country. Therefore, the distribution of income throughout the country will improve. Secondly, the fact that the producers of the “Green New Deal” not only put in place what we need to do to be more sustainable and how we can do it, but also what we need to do to protect people so they are not impacted in major ways by the deal. 
   <br><br>


It was crazy to read all the crises that the US has currently experienced, for example, the fact that in the country, the life expectancy is declining, basic needs (clean air, water, food, health care, housing, transportation, education) are inaccessible to a large population of the US. I was also not aware that there we’re in a 4 decade trend of wage stagnation, deindustrialization, anti-labor policies, which have resulted in hourly wages stagnating since the 1970s, despite an increase in productivity, the 3rd worst level of socioeconomic mobility in the developed world before the Great Depression, an erosion of earning and bargaining power of workers and inadequate resources for public sector workers. The US is also currently enduring the Greatest income inequality since the 1920s with the top 1% earners earning 91% of gains after the Great Recession, a large racial wealth divide with 20 times more wealth being between the average white family and black family and there being a gender earnings gap with women earning only 80% as much as men. Therefore, that is one misconception about the “Green New Deal” that I think needs clarification. The deal is not only about achieving climate net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, but it is also about rectifying out the social situation, in making America a more desirable place to live for people of all races, genders, ages and socioeconomic standings.

Hey Jana,
   <br><br>
I really like the way that you put it! I definitely agree with you when you said how you were both surprised and disappointed that you haven't heard of this deal before. It is not just because you did not live in the US, it is just not something that many Americans have been exposed to. This is especially bad because if Americans don’t know that it even exists, how is it ever going to be implemented? People need to hear about this deal so that they can urge their representatives to support it.
   <br><br>
Furthermore, regarding how you mentioned that you liked this deal because it was not focused on the betterment of the 1 percent of society that is inexplicably rich, this is a problem that has been going on for so long. I am in History 17b right now and we are learning about the 1800’s in American. There has been a wage gap and wealth inequality for so long. It has been such a big issue in our society since the Gilded Age with the robber barons who owned so much of the USA's wealth. Of course, ideally, the distribution of inequality will decrease and there will be less people in poverty but it is going to take a lot of collective action in order for this to be feasible.
<br><Hr>
I too was astonished that I had not known about the contents of the Green New Deal, although I had heard the name before. While reading this I was also surprised to see all the damages that global warming could cause with just a 2 degree increase and seeing how they are indeed causing them right now. Some of the consequences they mentioned I had no idea of, like the trillions that would be or are currently being lost due to global warming. As well as the fact that we are currently and have been for the past 4 decades in a trend of wage stagnation, deindustrialization, and anti-labor policies. 
   <br><br>


I will also say that I did not view this policy in the same light that you did, although I was astonished by what was happening due to global warming, when the Deal began to talk about what we need to do, I became a bit cynical. I just see it as nearly impossible to reach a net-zero green house gas emission. It all sounded a bit too much like a dream. Who will implement all these ideas, we have so many people who are deniers, how can we change their minds. And the top 1% are full of many deniers, money runs our country, so how do we bring about this change when we are battling the higher-ups.



<br><Hr>
First off, I’m just as shocked as you because I’ve also never heard of the Green New Deal and I’ve lived in the United States my entire life, and it’s disappointing that it is made known around the world, because as Romi said, how is this supposed to be implemented if no one has ever heard about it, because if this was broadcasted to the nation then people could get their representatives to support it. And regarding your comment about the significant wealth gap between white and black families, that’s always been there and frankly I’m not sure it’s going to change because that’s purely based on social injustice. Black men and women all through history have been known to be discriminated against, for all sorts of the thing for a while many Black people wouldn’t even get hired because of their hair style. There’s always going to be some type of social injustice for Black people and people of color no matter what, and in my opinion America will never be a desirable place for people like me to live in, but it’s the only place where we have a chance.



<br><Hr>
I too was not aware of what the Green New Deal was and what it had to say. I have heard people talk about it but never bothered to look into it. This plans out how we are to tackle the climate crisis and the goals we need to achieve in order for this to work. It was crazy to see how in the US, life-expectancy is declining and a great portion of the population does not have the basic needs to survive, yet the US does nothing about it. As long as they see economic growth, they don’t care about the consequences. The Green New Deal not only discusses the climate crisis, but also inequality amongst people, such as women earning 80% of what a man earns and a white family being 20 times richer than a black family. The US must figure out how to begin combating the climate crisis and balancing out the economy in order for everyone to live a better life.



<br><Hr>
I totally agree with your comment and what you said about how the Green New Deal is for more than just the 'one percenters'. The climate crisis shouldn't be only focused on people who have money to pay for the damages or prepare for distastes beforehand. There are people who can't afford a house or don't know where their next meal is coming from, let alone the ability to live through a fire or hurricane caused by anthropogenic climate change. This concept of systemic injustice can be applied within America and applied to the world as a whole. There is a huge gap between the wealthiest and poorest people in America and America compared to countries like Ken referred to, Bangladesh. It goes along with another aspect of 'systemic injustices' like low income housing near factories producing constant smoke or areas with contaminated water. 
   <br><br>
I also think as much as the Green New Deal may seem 'radical' or 'extreme' it's a deal for the people. It aims to creates jobs, invest in infrastructure, and yes also reduce greenhouse gas emissions...is that such a radical idea? The American people are almost always struggling with unemployment and America is almost always in debt. Why would we wait until climate change gets worse and deal with all the clean up and expenses, when we have this planned laid out right in front of us? I think that in media and politics environmental issues can get portrayed very inaccurately. Like, yes of course most environmentalists want nature to be restored and not destroyed by humans, but the climate crisis is a totally different issue. The Green New deal speaks volumes of the array of injustices that climate change has on the American people and all developing countries. The goal of reducing green house gas emissions pretty much benefits everyone in the process, except for stubborn, greedy and ignorant people who can't wrap their minds around change.



<br><Hr>
I agree with your comment; this reading was really helpful at understanding what the Green New Deal really is. I had previously heard of it in the past, but never really knew of the content it contained. I was surprised by how it acknowledged that our country is a great cause of the climate crisis, which I think is really effective. It’s a good thing that our nation recognizes it has made many mistakes and is willing to help and support others to work in solving it. I see this Green New Deal as a great start to addressing and solving this issue and feel it just needs the right people in control to put it to use. I also found it interesting as well how a lot of things are declining like life expectancy, and how a significant amount don’t have access to education or even health care. This plan could be a great start to solving issues like inequality and to find alternatives to improve the planet’s state, but the real question is whether our nation will take a big risk like this. There’s already a lot of people heavily attacking and against it due to the fact it’ll require them to give up a lot of the things they love doing. I just hope this plan causes many more solutions to be proposed in the near future.



<br><Hr>
I was surprised as well and thought you wrote a very good comment. I had never heard of this deal before either and I think the few people who have don't know what it even is. The public needs to know that something like this exists and I too think it is extremely important that we get some sort of deal that guarantees that all of society benefits. I was unaware the US was enduring the greatest income inequality since the 1920s. Those figures of 1% earning 91% are astonishing. The Green New deal seems to cover a lot of important aspects. If something can be done to make 99% of the population happier, that would definitely be the optimal thing to do.



<br><Hr>
Even though I had heard of the Green New Deal before, I had never actually read the deal itself and the details of it. Now that I have read it though I definitely agree with you Jana on the fact that the Green New Deal focused on supporting and protecting those who are not in the 1% group of Americans. A specific part that showcased this was when the Green New Deal outlined the idea of protecting indigenous people and their lands. If any changes were to be made that regarded them in any way then they would be consulted. If the indigenous people don't agree with something, then their opinion and traditions will be respected. Also, even though it is a document that is trying to address environmental issues, there is a large focus on environmental injustices. This was important to me because often times people only focus on the environmental aspect and don't realize how this can affect others. Although some of the goals might be hard to reach, I feel that it's a necessary step to push the United States in the right direction.



<br><Hr>
Although I appreciate the existence of the Green New Deal, I do not think that it is enough. I like that it addresses the concerns of the people--especially the less privileged people--but I think that they have much more to do to really enact those ideals listed. I hope that real plans will be made in light of it very soon. If we have until 2030 to cut our total emissions in half, I would think we would need to come up with specific plans as soon as possible. I do not imagine this to be something that the federal government would figure out alone, since there are many nuances to consider (as we know from the concept of environmental justice). Thus, I hope that state and local governments will follow suit immediately after the Green New Deal (hopefully) is accepted. 
   <br><br>

I also was surprised (but not really that surprised at the same time) by the fact that life expectancy is declining in the United States. One would think that, with all the technological advances we have made over the decades, that life expectancy would equally increase.  This should be an early warning sign that technology is not the answer (similar to the concept of electrifying vehicles being far from the solution to reducing our carbon footprint).



<br><Hr>
The deal is not only about achieving climate net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, but it is also about rectifying the social situation, in making America a more desirable place to live for people of all races, genders, ages and socioeconomic standings… You said this very eloquently and I agree with this! Not only did reading this give me the knowledge of what the New Green Deal truly is and encompasses, but it helped me realize that it looks out for those struggling in society, especially by environmental injustice. Clarification is absolutely necessary for the rest of the population to realize that this is not something without logic, but the most logical thing to do in our situation. Our world is built on the foundation of CO2 emissions. It is quite difficult as consumers to avoid this problem because our daily tasks on a day-to-day basis can have things to do with companies that produced items from fracking. Additionally, the things that we may do could result in emitting CO2, such as driving to work or for other errands.
   <br><br>

Something that struck me during the reading was definitely its acknowledgement of climate injustice. Sometimes we fail to see how the climate crisis affects demographics like the poor and the homeless. I remember in this scene of the Oscars Best Picture “Parasite” in which there was heavy rain and the poor families who lived in semi-basements that were flooding as a result had to evacuate into a public gym and sleep side to side with a bunch of other homeless people. The ignorance of the higher class was emphasized in a later scene where a rich woman praised the rain for clearing the air, happily neglecting any negative effects the rain could have had on other people. Now, there must be times where we resemble this too. Hot weather, we may thank for the perfect amount of heat to go swimming. This just reveals her privilege and ours in society; we must use our privilege to assist others.
   <br><br>

And unfortunately, we have not been doing that. Instead, we have been the real problem. We have an obesity problem while other countries are suffering with chronic hunger. We are considered a first world country while third world countries take in all development, even if it impacts their environment poorly. On top of this and more, the U.S. uses up way more CO2 emissions with frequent flying to meat eating.
   <br><br>

Many countries do not have the equipment or money to combat the climate crisis like we can, but are doing a better job at living their lives in a way that combats the climate crisis. It may not be intentional due to their position in society, but the way we live is indeed intentional. From these past weeks, we learned that treating the aftermath of the climate crisis is expensive. It’s been pointed out, for instance, that fires take a lot of money in order to be treated and it additionally takes a lot of money to repair what had occurred to the landscape and infrastructure it harmed. The things we must do to combat it, that plan also needs heavy investments as well. However, at least it would be to repair our earth completely and not to simply continuously target damages from ecological catastrophes that could have been prevented. And, the climate injustice that millions of other inhabitants face, there is no compensation for that... We can only help change their circumstances now, with our privilege, by living lives that combat the climate crisis and voting for policies and politicians that want the same.

This week’s reading is pretty encouraging, and I also have the same feeling as you do that reading “The Green New Deal” made me feel like I was reading the future in a sense. This represents a lead action from the political world, which is crucial to significant and large-scale changes beneficial for the wellness of our planet and the diverse species, including human, depending on it. One thing I really like about the Green New Deal is that it not only lists the environmental changes that need to be enacted but also ways to mitigate or solve the social and economic problems resulting from those changes, such as loss of jobs and income inequality. I think this makes the deal more practical and able to be implemented. However, I also think that this deal is relatively vague in describing the goals and actions we need to practice, but I also think that a general outline is a good start for more specific policies. As you described, the Green New Deal addresses many social and economic issues, which can rectify not only environmental problems but aims to make America a better place in a relatively comprehensive way. 
    <br><br>

Moreover, I also like how Ken address the problems of social, environmental, and climate justice in his lecture. Ken uses the US and Bangladesh to sharply illustrate the severe injustice across the globe, and I admire Ken’s global perspective, which encourages us to think about without a geographic boundary and hence to look at the probably most severe case of injustice. I also admire the fact that Ken can objectively see the privilege he and his country benefit from the pollution the US made and the privilege his country own, as shown by his example of mitigating Thomas fire. This made me kind of angry as the major polluter benefits from their pollution – distinct injustice. Surely, something should be done to rectify the current situation. Developed countries like the US may increase its fund to countries like Bangladesh, and more importantly, some technology and education resources may be shared so that they can have improvements in infrastructure and economic development that can proceed responsibly and sustainably.

I also like how the deal not only plainly lists out what we can do to counter the crisis, but also how people can be impacted as less as possible by the deal. It’s sad to get to know some consequences caused by climate crisis: life expectancy is declining and large percentage of population can’t meet their basic needs, and, even worse, people from countries, that doesn’t contribute much to the emission, have to suffer the most. A Green New Deal focuses on reducing the emission to zero; While it will take a long time to make that happen and many people will most likely be affected to achieve this ultimate goal, it’s important for us to realize that those people from poorer countries deserve better life, those people with lower income deserve better life, and we need to think more unselfishly when we fly all over the place.

I think the reason that you didn't see it publicized so much is because the USA doesn't want people to know about it. We are essentially run off of oil, beef, and anything that will kill the planet. So many of the wealthy people have their money invested and built off of these companies that they don't want the public to know about things like the green new deal. I like that you also bring up the "rectifying the social situation" aspect of the green new deal, because in reality the green new deal isn't about fixing the lives of just the 91%, it's about making the planet a better place to live for everyone, cause climate change does effect everyone.

After reading the first paragraph of your comment, I was amazed by your thought and I liked a lot. Not only educating people to learn about climate change but also the organizations or government needs to have a plan addressing this issue. Education is not enough. Taking actions is “real” and will influence our planet. It is imperative that everyone begins to act as soon as possible. Also, I liked your comment about the gap between rich and poor people in the United States in your second paragraph. One essential part is that everyone ought to have the same treatment and rights, but it seems kind of impossible to achieve this goal in almost every country in the world. Therefore, the government or some organizations need to try their best to decrease the inequality between people and make those people with low salaries and social status still get similar treatment to those who were rich. “Equality” is one of the most important social justice issues in the world right now, and the government needs to minimize the negative effects on those who do not have a “colorful” life.

I loved the idea of the Green New Deal.  Of course I want “frontline and vulnerable communities” to be paid attention to, of course I want high quality healthcare, safe housing, economic security, and clean air, food, and access to nature.  There would be no reason I wouldn’t. It sounds like it would create a perfect world of harmony, happiness, and health.  
     <br><br>
 And yet, there were problems I could not ignore -- like how the government is expected to do all of this.  I feel as though the Green New Deal is saying we should do all of these things without saying how they will be done.  I agree that there are some costs that the US, who is already in debt, should not be supporting financially, such as mass militarization (which has a huge environmental cost as well, which you can read about at “https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/social/environment”, seriously there are some interesting and mind boggling facts about the pollution that war brings), but that does not mean that we would still be able to fund all the demands the Green New Deal makes.  For example, “(E) upgrading all existing buildings in the United States and building new buildings to achieve maximum energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability, including through electrification;”. All existing buildings? How will that be done? Would the government do it themselves? This is the opposite of capitalism, and would not work out if it were to be put in action.  As with “ensuring safe housing” and “healthy and affordable food”, it gets tricky ... there is no way for the government to be responsible for this much change.  Instead, it has to support it through subsidizations and incentives to increase productivity in the private sector as well to ensure competition and a good economy throughout the process of transferring to a cleaner country.  Providing that to everyone no matter their class or race is necessary, but it needs to be done in a certain way that does not seem feasible.  We have to try though.

One glaring issue with the Green New Deal after reading it in its entirety is AOC’s inconsistency with fixing the climate and pushing an agenda from a leftist view while not having a grasp of economics. At one point before she took down the document she claimed to give everyone a living wage that chooses to work. Great, I don’t disagree, but she also claims to provide a living wage to everyone who is and I quote “unwilling to work.” So why would anyone work? Now maybe she meant people who are disabled or have a family to take care of and can’t work which is a discussion that should be had. The problem is when you try to pass a bill you want someone that you feel at least has a basic grasp of the English language, but slip ups happen and maybe she corrected herself in the FAQ’s of the document. But she doesn’t do that…. At all. Instead she takes down the document on her website and re-uploaded it two days later. Without warning or explanation which is fine, she has every right to do so. She then goes on Twitter and claims that people are quoting an altered document and not the Green New Deal on her page. Never mentioning that she took the original document off of her page to begin with. While I’m not saying Climate Crisis isn’t a major issue in the world we live in today; I will argue that pushing AOC’s bill that ; seizes private land, promotes more government intervention in almost every major industry, promises to cut fossil fuel use completely within twelve years, guarantees that speed rails will render air travel useless and until she deleted and re-uploaded the document literally promises to pay people “unwilling to work”; that proposal might be hard to pass to even the average American. The average American will tell you as Hawaii rep. pointed out it would be hard for speed rails to render planes useless for places like… well Hawaii. Cortez’s promises for things that are to good to be true are just that. I’ve found that a majority of independent economist say this deal is nearly impossible finically and needs to be rewritten. I hope to see a deal proposed by actual climatologist and economist with a realistic plan. One where it doesn’t call for unconstitutional government intervention, a realistic plan how to do said things, and where it is not so easy for people on the right side of politics to point out such obvious flaws in the Green New Deal. The Climate Crisis IS REAL, I just see too many flaws with how the bill is written and that the person who wrote it has said in regards to criticism of the bill. If we want to get all off America on board, we need a better bill and a better figurehead for said bill. A figurehead that doesn’t shy away from certain questions on the bill and certainly not one who claims fake news when her bill was directly quoted off of her own site.

“Social justice, environmental justice, climate justice, and the injustice of it all”
     <br><br>
Green New Deal is related to the environmental justice and under the influence of cultures. The Deal is encouraging people to take actions to ease the tension of climate crisis. It is also a transformation of people’s lifestyle. Environmental justice might be easier to accomplish in developed country since those countries already pass the stages of economic survival, while developing and even under-developing countries are still struggling to keep its people from poverty. I think this is the main conflicts why environmental justice has so much challenges. 
     <br><br>
In the video, the consumption of meat in developed countries is much higher than developing countries that the meat production process is releasing many harmful gases that worsen the environment problem. So how developed countries to adjust? In my perspective, to encourage every country in the world to dedicate in environmental justice will need to based on an overall improvement in economy, environment justice is almost like a “luxury bag” to developing countries, they want it but could not afford it.

When reading "The Green New Deal '', I felt that I was reading a summary of everything we have learned on climate change up until this point. There was an overwhelming amount of things that need to be done to help our planet, but it makes sense since we have been putting an overwhelming amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. The part of "The Green New Deal '' that stuck out to me was how they mentioned that the land owned by indigenous people should be respected and they should not do anything with that land without consent. I liked this part because this is usually not a major focus when discussing climate change solutions. Usually we only are presented with the solutions to the problem of climate change and not the terms and condition we need to follow in order to achieve these solutions. I also liked how it presented multiple factors of this deal. It presented the solutions, benefits and the outcomes that will occur if we do not listen to these instructions. This deal lists a lot of things that need to be done, but I hope some people take this as a wake up call because even more things will have to be done and in sooner time, if these things are not achieved.
     <br><br>
When watching Ken's video "Social justice, environmental justice, climate justice, and the injustice of it all", I could not help but feel so incredibly sorry for Bangladesh. The US has emitted an enormous amount more of Co2 into the atmosphere than Bangladesh, but they are suffering so much more from it. You can just imagine how angry and frustrated Bangladesh must be with the US. The US has the means to help combat increasing CO2 where as Bangladesh does not. Many of the things that happen to the US would have completely destroyed Bangladesh. This made me feel very angry because they have a very small percentage to do with the increased CO2 and the US has a huge percentage yet will not suffer as much as Bangladesh will. Many of the conditions we face are not half as bad as they are in Bangladesh.

I like how you said that the Green New Deal was a summary of everything we have learned so far. This proves that we have always known how to stop climate change from worsening, but it never really happened. Your comment on Bangladesh suffering the physical consequences of climate change more than the people in America even though America pollutes the planet way more than Bangladesh does, reminds me of the video "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" that I watched a few weeks ago. America pollutes, yet factories with poor working conditions and landfills are in third-world countries. We can't call this "privilege" anymore. This is just straight up unfairness. I wonder if Americans live their lives the way poorer countries do, will the politicians finally realize that it is time to change? People often do not know how agonizing a certain situation is until they have been through it themselves.

After reading “The Green New Deal,” I felt like we really can save the future if we follow the solutions of the climate crisis. The article shows the problem and solution clearly and logically. It gives us the direction to make an effort, and the government should change its policies, recognize the duty to create a Green New Deal, and put money to protect the environment.
     <br><br>
The Green New Deal is a new concept and is a collective term for environmentally friendly policies. It mainly involves environmental protection, pollution prevention, energy conservation and emission reduction, climate change and other major issues related to the sustainable development of people and nature. In terms of investment, people turn to environmental projects that can create more job opportunities, invest in climate change, promote green economic growth and employment, and repair the natural ecosystems that support the global economy. Climate crisis and pollution disproportionately affecting some developing countries. People in developed countries have more cars and higher life quality than people in developing countries. Developed countries transfer of jobs and pollution overseas and developing countries help developed countries to produce goods which will release pollution. Therefore, developing countries’ environment worse off. According to the Green New Deal, this situation going to be ceased. It is patently unfair that the developing country should bear the burden of pollution emitted by developed countries. The extreme weather or disease caused by the climate crisis maybe will not have a huge impact on the people who have high life quality, but the negative impact shows on the people who are poor and live in a worse environment. 
     <br><br>
Not only we should take action to save our future, but the government also needs to take action. We should make some changes to protect ourselves, our family members, our countries, our planet.

I agree with you as well! Reading “The Green New Deal” gave me m hope that we can take care of our future for the entire planet if we, the human race, follow the solutions of the climate crisis. The Green New Deal is somewhat a new idea but with more of an emphasis nowadays, but with the focus of environment protection and emission reduction, we can stop climate change. To invest in other people besides ourselves in the U.S will allow the world to progress together in a healthy manner. We can make up for the damage we have done as a country on smaller countries by providing aid but also adopting their ways of environmentally friendly methods of consumption or production. To stop our secondary effects of pollution on smaller countries would really help the world which is an obvious thing to know but to get other people to understand this may be a harder thing to accomplish. The people cannot be the only ones advocating for change and you make a good point about this. It definitely needs to be the government who is involved with making the change as well. The world will follow us, as ignorant as that can sound, because the American culture is so well known and misunderstood at times around the world. Lets change the American culture to include the world for the goal of combating climate change.

When I read the “Green New Deal” I was very surprised how of the format of this article. It first talks about the diffrent consequences that could happen if we do not do anything for climate change. There would
     <br><br>
be more natural disasters and economic problems occuring in United States. And then it explains the diffrent types of solutions. The idea I think is the most challenging and benefical is 100 percent renewable resource energy. I could just imagine how the earth would be a much better place with no fossil fuels. Still being able to see nature and not be worried about natural disasters. But, people may argue that it would be very hard to adjust to this type of life without fossil fuels. It will be tuff, but we were able survive and change from the depression and world war 2 in the united states. We have to change for climate change in order to survive and give a great life to our future generations because our ancestorsdid the same

I agree that we should definitely move towards renewable resource energy. What do you think about the inequality in other nations? Do you think the US should help other developing nations move towards clean energy rather than fossil fuel? I think the wealthier nations are much more equipped and are generally not going to be drastically effected by climate change. We should use our wealth not only to solve the our internal issues outlined in the Green New Deal but the US should also fund other countries develop cleaner energy.


<br><hr>
I was also kinda surprised at the format of the "Green New Deal as I read it because it did first state the consequences if we don't do anything to help stop the effects of the climate crisis, but in a literary sense, it hooks the reader in, giving them a strong sense of urgency to make a change because those consequences are so dire. It's a very smart literary tactic and would allow for the reader to contemplate both sides of a fossil-free future and the challenges as you mentioned. Overall, the piece outlines the different steps one can take to mitigate the crisis and warns very accurately how the future will play out if no adequate changes are made.

This video opens my mind. "The Green New Deal" is a great read to me, I found it actually lighted the hope for the future in my deepmind. I agree with Ken that social justice, environmental justice, and climate justice are all related. Justice and injustice are corresponded. As the example Ken mentioned, factories can release large amounts of carbon dioxide gases or some environmentally unfriendly materials or even some toxic wastes to the atmosphere by paying some money or even without money. Yes, their actions probably are legal and protected under certain laws. However, this is injustice for the people in the neighborhoods nearby the factory. Do they have choices to leave? Maybe... However, since most of them are suffering from poverty, they probably do not have the opportunity or money to allow them to pick a better place to live. This is not fair to these "poor" people, this is injustice to them. They have done nothing wrong, probably they do not even own a car, which contributes a large amount of greenhouse gases. By living near a factory in the rural area, they have no chance to say something, but they need to breath the polluted air, drink the toxic water, and hear the noise. What I have talked about is from the people's microperspective. However, from the macro perspective, the country's GDP gets higher after having these heavy industrial companies. What the GDP does not count are natural resources and the pollution releases.

 
     <br><br>

Ken mentioned that hundreds of million dollars was used to treat the Thomas fire. I think why the government could not use these funds wisely before the tragedy happened. First, it is definitely a good idea to use this money for prevention. Prevention takes less money and it is more environmentally friendly. Second, this fund could go to education. As more people are well educated about the wildfire, the risk of fire could be significantly decreased, because most of the time the fire was started by human activities. Therefore, there are many things we can do, the government can do. We shall start from now and pay more attention to our planet and do what we could do to make it more suitable for future generations.

Growing up, I always enjoyed hearing stories from my parents, in part because they allowed my imagination to fill in various gaps and to actually visualize what they were saying. However, as I have gotten older, I have realized that there is a time and a place for imagination. For example, in a math lecture, it is perfectly alright to let your brain run wild and ignore what is happening, but, in the case of news or proposed legislation, it is far better to read the documents yourself than to repeatedly hear vague stories about the documents, allowing your imagination to govern what you think the documents say. The Green New Deal is the best example I can think of for this phenomena, as I heard from so many people that it is "too costly" or "too radical," phrases I often found myself repeating to others whenever the topic was brought up. However, after reading it, all the ambiguity has vanished, and I am left with clarity, for better or for worse. Just reading the document put to rest so many fears about it that my brain had simply manufactured without any factual basis. I found it especially insightful, as the second half of the document, detailing how to assist people who face job loss from its implementation, is usually left out of people's reviews of the document; I did not even know that part existed prior to reading it. If more people read it, I honestly feel like fewer people would oppose it as vehemently as they do now simply because of how it is portrayed by various pundits.

Before reading it, I had only heard of the Green New Deal, though I wish I read it sooner. It put physical statistics before my eyes that mark the true cost behind fighting climate change. This is a resolution for the damage climate change will cause if the United States (and the rest of the world) are willing to accept it. It brought to my attention how this moment in time is our last hope at fighting the effects of the rise of C02. The deal lists six points regarding the future of our planet. It points to both economical and environmental harm as they coincide with each-other. For instance they bring up how much coastal real estate will be impacted by the climate crisis. 
     <br><br>


The idea of coastal real estate and the effect climate change will have on it really struck a chord with me because my whole life I have lived near the coast and know plenty of people that live within five hundred feet of the shoreline. These people and their kids who inherit their property need to read this and understand their future could be at risk unless they act now. The rich are risk too, I feel like people only think climate change will effect the poorer class but its impacts will destroy the beauty we spend our money to be by. 

     <br><br>

AOC does a tremendous job laying out facts in a concise and coherent manner that anyone could comprehend. She and her team behind brought up more than just climate change, but the imbalance in our economy and how hard mobility is in the United States should be a pressing concern to the majority of society.

After reading the Green New Deal I was amazed to see such a progressive resolution being introduced but like one of the comments below, I realized that the resolution was introduced over a year ago. No actual progress has been achieved is what I was thinking. I then googled the Green New Deal and stumbled upon this article called, “So has the Green New Deal Won Yet?” by the Atlantic. The article speaks about how there was no special house committee for the Green New Deal just overall generic committees that discuss climate change. Again, I was met with disappointment, what was the point of introducing such a radical resolution if no changes were being made?

     <br><br>

Further in the article however, the author brings up the fact that the Green New Deal has in fact won. This deal rushed in a new era of daring attempts at tackling the climate change crisis and finally brought attention to our addiction to fossil fuels and how heavy it has been sown into our economy. No one wanted to address this addiction because then we would have to finally face the reality about how big this issue was and start the daunting task of weaning ourselves from it. So I finally understood that while there may not have been physical solutions being made, it was changing the cultural perspective on how real climate change is and leading Presidential candidates to finally have plans to address climate change.

     <br><br>

Shifting the attention back to the Resolution itself, I was also very surprised to see how inclusive it was to marginalized communities or like the resolution called them, "frontline communities".  These groups are always the ones being left behind and I'm glad they were included. However, these made me think about Bangladesh and how Ken mentioned if we are responsible in helping them and in my opinion, yes. It's not fair that we forced them to produce for survival and then let them deal with the consequences of our greed for more. We have a moral responsibility to these people, we cannot continue to live our life of luxury at the expense of their quality of life or at the expensive of their lives themselves. We cannot liberate our oppressed communities if we are oppressing another group to do so.

I think the Green New Deal--considering the fact that was blocked from the Senate--should not be evaluated as a policy that was meant to be in and of itself accepted and implemented immediately, but rather a policy that was meant to usher in an era of boulder, better, and more all-encompassing climate reform. Someone had to do it. Therefore, I think the merits of the green new deal and its advocacy for climate justice should not be viewed simply as a pass-fail metric for climate reform, but rather as a symbolic stance that the Democrats within the American government have chosen to take or support. As the video clearly explains, the US government is in a position to take a radical and vital stance to support climate policy: other countries like Bangladesh are not so lucky to be able to think about climate change and climate reform in a symbolic manner. Therefore, it should be given due merit that climate justice in general, though “radical” in its scope, needs to be tangible in order to deal with the global scale that the climate crisis creates. 
      <br><br>
Additionally, I totally agree with the powerful substantive considerations that the Green New Deal gives to marginalized and native communities. The climate crisis gives the US government the opportunity to create reform for those who can be potentially most effective by the crisis, falling under the umbrella term of environmental racism. At the same time, I think that if the US has concurrently not given a shit about those affected by the climate crisis in other countries, I don't have hope that those affected domestically will be treated any differently.



<br><hr>

I really enjoyed this comment and totally agree with you. It is one thing to propose such a progressive resolution but it is another thing to act on it. If no changes are being made then what is the point of all of this? At the end of the day the point is to keep spreading awareness in hopes that the public will someday wake up and see the damage that is happening in front of us before it is too late. Im happy to hear that the Green New Deal is beginning to change societies cultural perspective and I hope that this continues to happen without the interruption and successful reversal by fossil fuel lobbyists. 
      <br><br>

Personally I think that the actual proposal of the Green New Deal should get more attention as I don't think enough people quite exactly what this deal proposes. This is bad news because, for instance, one tweet from trump can cause an entire wave of cynicism in our society. It is important that tactical framing is corrected and that the people get the right information so that support can be gathered and actions can be made. 
      <br><br>

Lastly, my only disagreement with the proposed solution is that it focuses on alot of issues that are not very related to the climate crisis at hand. Don't get me wrong, while inequality is terrible and should be dealt with  immediately, I think there should be more emphasis on reducing emissions and the creation of a plan for those affected by the transition.

I agree that reading the Green New Deal filled me with hope to see real change beginning in our country. While at first it seems nothing concrete has been done, it is quite simple to see that the Green New Deal has already begun its work fighting the climate crisis. Though no actual legislation has been put in place to make the Green New Deal a reality, it has gotten the word out. Just like you pointed out, it has politicians talking about it and using it within their platforms. The Green New Deal is radical. These ideas are revolutionary and that scares people; fortunately sometimes that leads to being shocked into action. Because of how we live our lives now, we don't have time for slow, moderate changes. This crisis demands action and that is exactly what the Green New Deal matches. I think you wonderfully state that this deal changes our cultural perspective and sets in motion a wave of information and rising passion towards this issue. This momentum is crucial to meet the radical change this crisis demands. 

      <br><br>

As a developed country beginning to step up to the challenge, I also agree that we are responsible for helping other parts of the world like Bangladesh. The climate crisis is a global issue and the United States, having the advantages that it does, has a duty to be of use in aiding other countries to evolve and develop in efficient ways. Furthermore, the United States is a top contributor of greenhouse gases, the least we can do is clean up our mess, and then go on to help the rest of the world by learning from our mistakes.

When reading the green new deal I was incredibly conflicted. I am glad that I watched the videos Ken assigned for our film this week because they really did give me a fuller understanding of what exactly the green new deal aims to do. Action must be taken, and seeing as many are divided and unrelenting in their opinions, it is likely that this action may have to be enforced. I want to see progress being made on all levels, personal, social and political. In some ways, the green new deal promises to achieve this, however, the problem with the green new deal is that it is so extreme that even if it was made into legislation, it would have devastating consequences. The second part of the green new deal does address the most obvious of these problems, unfortunately it fails to address certain possible outcomes such as civil war. While this may sound like an extreme conclusion to jump to, it is actually not so far fetched to assume that such a fast paced and invasive change would result in a major conflict such as war. It is even more easily conceived when one considers the precarious state of politics in this country at this time; for instance President Trumps election was so controversial it teased at the possibility as many people rallied behind the phrase: not my president. Ultimately, the green new deal is just too idealistic for the reality that we live in. It assumes people are good, capable of unity, and want to change.

After reading “Green New Deal,” I felt hope again. Through this quarter, I was very depressed by the climate change happening nowadays. I was pessimistic. Reading the Green New Deal, I realize that people are not just talking about it, they are making practicable plans. New Deal helped the America out of economic crisis, and hopefully Green New Deal will help the word out of climate crisis as well. Green New Deal brought up with many aspects that we can make efforts toward, such as protecting coral reefs, reducing green house emission, saving wildlife, etc. These are very specific and better than slogans. Green New Deal makes me see what we are supposed to focus on and hold hopes for saving the planet.

I completely agree with you in regard to how the "Green New Deal" inspires hope. When one thinks of how climate change is happening and the immense negative impact it has on all of us a whole, it can get quite depressing and overwhelming. I think this is due to the fact that it is such a big issue that can be really hard to come back from if we do not stop it. It is especially disheartening when we notice in the media and general public that climate change is not a primary concern for many people when it takes the cooperation of the majority to make a significant change. However, the Green New Deal demonstrates how there are people who are serious about climate change and how to stop it. More importantly, it serves as a template for what we need to do and the areas we need to focus on. As you mentioned, by specifically signaling to topics such as the coral reefs and greenhouse emission, it points the readers and general public to real plausible areas that need to be worked on to halt climate change.

I was really disappointed to realize that this was the first time I had ever read anything on the Green New Deal. I have vaguely heard of it in the past but I never really knew exactly what it was or what it could mean for the future of our country. While reading it though, I was both excited and shocked about what exactly the Green New Deal entailed. I was excited because I felt like finally (even if it is only a few) there are politicians who understand how urgent this issue is - and who actually want to make a change. I was excited to read that there was preparation and honestly in the proposal. They knew that the transition could potentially hurt us at first, but were equipped with solutions to help us understand what exactly could be done to help alleviate those problems a bit.  I was excited to read that I finally did not feel like the only one who believed that the current crisis was hindering other sorts of disparity and social issues beyond climate. Not to mention that they provided ways on how those inequalities could be helped and alleviated as well. I was shocked however, at the thought that the Green New Deal is seen as just a phony and unrealistic proposal. Shocked about how (mostly republican) politicians could read this, and still not see the great benefits that the Deal offers, despite the attraction of those benefits are beyond the repair of our globe. I was mostly shocked to realize that no matter how great this proposition is, the chances of it coming into effect is slim to none. How this great strategy is going to be nothing more than a strategy and we will still continue to waste away and watch as our planet dies.

I too liked the Green New Deal for the fact that it did not focus on the one percenters, but instead focused on the working class and the environment. It looks out for everyone and makes the promise that even if we were to shut down fossil fuel factories, those people would not be without a job afterwards. Not only does it aim to help the working class, it aims to help save the planet. We are nearing the1.5-2 degree Celsius point. if we were to ever cross that point there would be no going back from that. Major catastrophes would occur if we were to cross or even reach that point such more wildfires like the Thomas fire. I think the Green New Deal would be a helpful thing for all of us. I feel that politicians and other people who are in the one percent would not want to get the deal passed because it

Ah, reading your comment, I didn’t feel alone. I had heard about the Green New Deal, however I had not had the chance to read about it either or learn about it. I felt the same emotions as you, or similar to you, when I first read it as well. All of this was extremely exciting but worrying. The information on the deal was a great action to move forward to ensure that the climate crisis does not get worse than it already is, however, also knowing that there were people who were against it and voted against making changes that would positively be better for the planet, it leaves one to wonder how greedy those politicians truly are.

“The Green New Deal” is exciting to me because this means that the government is not ignoring it. Meanwhile, the government is also aware of the potential issue of massive job loss. When new things are built, it is usually those who hold power benefit the most and those who are in a disadvantaged position who lose the most. Hence, I think it is good that the government makes an effort the reduce that socio-economic inequality. However, “The Green New Deal” might seem too ideal to implement. For instance, who is going to provide health care, education, and training? Government? Do they have enough money to do that? Will they increase the tax? Wealthy company? Will this still create racial and gender inequality? Those problems could be a barrier to implementing the policy and even passing the policy. However, I am still glad that the government is making an effort to solve the issue since, throughout the quarter, I saw denials and monetary manipulations of information.

The "Green New Deal," was a very interesting read, providing powerful insight on the political aspect on how to progress in the climate crisis. Ken makes a really interesting point when he talks about the long lasting environmental damages that result from fires. After a fire, lives are lost, homes are destroyed, and natural ecosystems are damaged. The rapid spread of wildfires is a direct result of climate change, making it difficult to put out fires and prevent them from happening.

After reading the resolution #109 of the U.S. House of Representative, I was surprised that the government has come up with so many useful solutions towards the climate change. It provides us with some major problems we are facing, and well explained how this problems are closely related to climate change. Before reading this, I do not realize that the climate change can actually threaten the national security of US by impacting the economics, environments, and social securities of the world. As the resolution has stated, it also gives the goals such as eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, and guaranteeing citizens’ access to clean water. This is exciting and inspiring. This resolution is introduced exactly one year ago, and the solutions are indeed effective and useful. However, as what I have seen and experienced, most of these projects and goals are not yet completed. I am looking forward to seeing brand new communities after the completion of the projects.

I agree with the points you have made. I was too surprise to find out that the climate crisis also impacts on the economics, environments, and social securities of the world. I thought it was simply an environmental issue that causes droughts, floods, and wildfires; which in turn ruin peoples lives. The Green New Deal gave me some hope  as it does state the problems we are facing but it also offers reasonable solutions that can easily be put in practice. Which is why, like Ken mentioned in previous videos, we need to vote and  elect politicians that would pass these sort of bills to legislation, because only then will we be able to actually fight back the climate change. 
      <br><br>
We are all individually doing our part, but we need the support of our politicians in order to begin seeing a decrease in the amount of greenhouse gas emissions as their companies such as the fossil fuel industry are emitting an enormous amount.

As I was reading the Green New Deal, I found myself agreeing to the solutions of our economic, social, and environmental problems like creating millions of jobs, having net-zero emissions, invest in prevention of climate change related events, and practice climate resiliency. What I also found was that I was asking a lot of "how's". This Green New Deal is like an outline to what would happen if we took it seriously and collaborated together to make it work. I'm not entirely sure if this plan would convince me if I was a politician, I'd want to know we're going to make it work, how we're going to save the planet without disrupting society but I honestly believe that that's not going to happen. Politicians have waited out on taking action because they're afraid to lose supporters and their donors but change needs to happen now and it'll be hell for lots of people but it's the consequences we have to deal with. We have to take responsibility for putting the planet in the critical state that it is right now. What I did like about this plan is that it seems easy and doable, it makes sense. I also liked that a big portion of it talked about economic security, an issue that a lot of people fear if polluting industries were to be abolished. We spend a lot of time talking about our environmental impact on the planet and we forget that some people unfortunately do hold jobs there, whether it's by choice or not and they do have to be taken care of. 
      <br><br>
I'm very familiar with the term "environmental justice". It means that all people should have access to clean water, air, and soil, among other things. This is something all people deserve regardless of any demographic, yet there are millions who live in contaminated areas with scarce food and no type of resources to help themselves. Back at home in southeast LA, there are polluting factories everywhere, next to parks, schools, and homes. We have more than 20 superfund sites in our area, these sites are so contaminated that no one is allowed to be on or near them and yet there they are in the communities of people of color and low-income. The situation is nothing like it is in places like Bangladesh but the people in these communities also end up developing respiratory problems and it becomes passed onto the next generations because the contamination is already in this area, people are born into locations like these without a choice and sometimes even have to work in these factories because it's the only job available. These people expose themselves to high levels of toxins and then go home and bring everything with them. Industries like these are making money off of people's health and sometimes even their lives and its not fair that they're not held accountable for the hazards they impose on people and on the community.

I really enjoyed this weeks reading, mostly because I appreciated seeing some political action on the climate crisis. This sort of political activism could be revolutionary in the way the US progresses in concern to the environmental practices economically which in turn would have a great impact on social factors throughout the country. The first thing I noticed about the reading was Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez's name on the document which immediately caught my interest because I admire her intelligence and political perspective which in turn made me more interested in this proposition to help the climate crisis. The opening statistics about the detriment the US would be placed at if they didn't respond to the climate crisis, were really eye opening and made me feel (despite the fact I've had a great concern for our future throughout the course) extremely worried about the near future of our environment. I find it hard to fathom that over a trillion dollars of damage would be done to the US coast if a temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius occurred globally simply because I can't imagine that much money or even the extent of how damaged the US coasts would be to cause this kind of expense. In response to this concern, I found the propositions to prevent these consequences to be quite moderate: switch to clean energy, work on sustainable animal/plant agriculture, updating infrastructure, creation of new clean production jobs. This is a realistic switch to an economy that would benefit everyone, and prove to be a sustainable way to decrease emissions, and furthermore increase quality of life. 
      <br><br>

In terms of what Ken had to comment on in relation to the "Green New Deal", I personally believe that the US should take some role in the Bangladesh situation. These are our US owned factories that are affecting the people of Bangladesh by putting them in a dangerous work environment and destroying their environment. Therefore we should have some responsibility for what is occurring in Bangladesh environmentally. While I am no politician,  I believe the US can still pay Bangladesh for the land use, fair wages, and even work towards making these factories more effective by switching to clean energy, strengthening the infrastructure, and enforcing some sort of employee benefits to ensure quality of product, and more importantly quality of life for the workers. This in turn, would promote economic growth in Bangladesh in which the US could take a role in assisting them politically as an ally to help combat their future demise (if not acted upon) to the consequences of climate change.

I agree with you that the Green New Deal propositions are as moderate as you can get when it comes to politics. It's unfortunate and honestly quite ridiculous that we see this as some socialist or extreme leftist agenda. Last time I checked the earth was neither democratic or republican, and the same can be said of the billions of creatures that live on earth. We owe it to not only them but to humanity, to amend our wrong doings and lead the world to a promising future. America takes pride in being the world leader of innovation and being the wealthiest, yet I feel no pride when I acknowledge the suffering and consequences it has caused. 
      <br><br>

I also agree that this is a realistic switch, however, when fossil fuel interests and big corporations (that benefit from the current economy) stifle again and again innovation and awareness of climate change, this realistic switch seems to get less and less realistic. As I read The Green New Deal, I couldn't help but imagine if all the goals came to fruition, and I loved what I saw. A country that cares about the people and the environment, none more important than the other because we both share this beautiful planet that we call home. 
      <br><br>

I am a democrat, but if The Green New Deal would have been introduced by a Republican, I would have undoubtedly supported it as well. At this point in the crisis, its not about voting by party lines, it's about voting for the survival of humanity and the protection of the environment.

Throughout this course I have been overwhelmed by the amount that needs to be done and how little action seems to be occurring. I agree with you that it is nice to finally see someone presenting a proposal to the solution even if it is just the beginning steps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a politician I have also admired because of her ability to fight the odds against her and stand up strongly for the course of action she feels is necessary. She did a great job of presenting the information in a way that would encourage people to act. By predicting what will happen at a 2 degrees Celsius rise, like mass migration, trillions of dollars lost, wildfires, heat stress, and millions of lives lost, she is calling on urgent action to prevent this from occurring and instilling the fear we all should be having into other politician’s minds. When reading the issues climate change is causing, I saw the statistic about trillions of dollars being lost and immediately thought, “This is the issue most politicians are going to care about.” It is a sad truth, but I believe that the only way to convince money hungry politicians that are being fed by lobbyists is to demonstrate how the climate crisis is going to affect the economy and national security. I think AOC will have a very difficult time getting the Green New Deal to pass because of all the accusations of her trying to create a socialist society. While her goals of Green New Deal mobilization and simultaneously fighting the inequality of our economy are very ambitious, I do think that they could be achieved if everyone commits to the cause. 
      <br><br>


I also agree that the US should take a role in helping the developing countries around the world, like Bangladesh, that are facing the effects of the climate crisis we created and also do not have the money and resources to help themselves. We should be responsible for any inequalities caused from outsourcing or our own production which is why I also agree we should be at least compensating them for fair wages and the pollution created from these factories that the US ultimately owns. By the United States taking action and helping other countries, I believe that other developed countries will help do the same. Since we have the money and technology to run on clean energy sources, we should be the ones making the steps in the right direction. It was crazy to hear that we eat 6,600% more, fly 14,000% more, and have 21,000% higher car ownership than Bangladesh. Yet we are the ones who go unaffected by all the emissions we are creating, leaving everyone who is not contributing nearly as much to face the consequences. And as a developed country, we should be the ones paying for these external costs.

I also found the economical statistics to be very shocking and worrying. Including them in the Green New Deal was a smart move from politicians, as it may be the only motivation large companies have to change their ways. Maybe knowing that the entire economy will collapse will push money-obsessed companies to become more sustainable. Like you said, the moderate changes that would have to be made are practically nothing than the damage that will be caused by doing nothing. The numbers seem almost unrealistically huge, and it is very concerning that despite this oncoming disaster, many companies and people prefer to profit off of environmentally damaging practices, such as animal agriculture or oil, than save the future of the planet.
      <br><br>
I agree that the US is at fault for many of the environmental, social, and economic issues in Bangladesh. While this is true, the US is also at fault for many, many similar issues in countless other nations as well as Bangladesh. If the US cannot convince its own country to become environmentally friendly, provide social welfare, and make choices to improve the economy, I doubt it would be possible to convince the same people and same politicians to use money to provide these resources elsewhere, in another country. The US very much can, and should, pay for these issues in Bangladesh, however it is very unlikely that they will actually do so. Maybe, another solution could involve convincing the US public that climate change needs to be urgently addressed, becoming a leader in environmental change that other countries will follow, and then use the money and resources generated from economic growth to aid the countries it has exploited. By becoming a model for environmental change, it will be much easier to convince other countries to follow suit and much easier to convince its own people of the benefits of funding international environmental change.

I did have a lot of touch after watching Ken's video. As a big economic country like the United States, the air travel rate and car ownership rate also say that the food consumption rate is far higher than that of a small country like Bangladesh. However, if there is a natural disaster like flood, people in Bangladesh who do not cause a lot of harm to the environment will suffer more because they do not have much extra financial resources to prevent and respond to natural disasters Attack. Ken also mentioned that when a forest fire like Tomas fire broke out, a big country like the United States had the spare power to deal with it, while other small countries did not have the huge financial resources and equipment to resist it, which was obviously unfair. There is no need to pay such a high price for natural disasters that are not caused by themselves. This is also worthy of our appeal to protect the natural environment and reduce extravagance and waste. However, the plan mentioned in the article makes me feel a little different. I'm not saying the method is wrong, but I don't think every one can be done. These proposals seem reasonable and easy, but in fact, they can be implemented in a short time. As shown in the previous videos, it is very difficult to achieve environmental protection without affecting economic development, let alone spend more money on improving the environment and the working environment of citizens, so as to improve people's self-esteem However, I feel this kind of thing. If there is a plan that will obviously affect economic development and improve the environment in front of the government, I believe that almost no one will adopt it, at least before the real end is coming, no real government will adopt it.

I completely agree with you that it was so nice to see some form of political action on the climate crisis. We constantly talk about the things that can be done, should be done, and will be done, but it’s much more rare that we hear about the things that are being done. While I’m not 100% sure the United States will actually follow through with the Green New Deal it is unarguably a step in the right direction, especially if we at least try to go through with it/accomplish some of it. I think while meeting those goals will be challenging, it is realistic. Like you said, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortex’s name was on the document, which I view as a sign that younger generations are taking concrete action on the climate change problem. 
      <br><br>
It also shocked me that so many people use the argument that fighting climate change is “too expensive” when the cost of not doing anything is exponential and will eventually cost us billions, if not trillions, of dollars. However, I found it encouraging that the Green New Deal also focused somewhat on climate justice, ensuring that people will have access to clean water and food, as well as well-paying jobs.
      <br><br>

As far as Ken’s video, I found it surprising that more energy actually needs to be used in underdeveloped countries - I had just assumed we needed to use less energy anywhere and everywhere. It was also shocking to hear that there is 21,000% more car ownership in the United States; I know we constantly hear surprising statistics, but that number is huge! I also have to agree with you in that the U.S. should take the role as a leader in the climate crisis, especially since we are such a huge part of the problem, producing 20% of annual greenhouse gas emissions. And there are so many ways through which we could do this: by being a global leader/role model by taking action ourselves, by assisting underdeveloped countries politically, or by ensuring global climate justice.

I agree with your comment post above. Like you, I enjoyed this week's reading because of the political involvement on climate crisis. However, I disagree on the political 'action' that you concluded, just because, I believe theres not enough 'authentic' action happening despite the fact that the text emerges as a good starting point for society to engage in dealing with this issue. There is much to say about climate crisis and too many 'do this' and 'to promote, secure' but not enough context regarding what our political leaders are doing or if they are really practicing what they preach. Similarly, I also found that the opening statistics about the detriment of US is truly alarming, the persuasion effect of that opener is successful in so many cases just because it showcases the destruction and damage that are planet been through and currently going through as we, 'humanity' continues to contribute to the climate crisis. I definitely felt worried about the statistics of climate crisis and how it will affect our future and the next generations to come.

I also really enjoyed this weeks reading. I had never read the Green New Deal before, yet I had heard so much about it and knew I wanted to support it. I felt odd not having read the actual document meanwhile I've told my parents that we need a Green New Deal. Ocasio-Cortez's name also caught my eye, because I had no idea she was behind the Green New Deal until I watched this weeks videos. I too admire her intelligence and I also admire her strength in the face of adversity. 
      <br><br>


A trillion dollars of damage is hard to fathom from anyone's perspective, so you're not alone in that. I can barely fathom 100k dollars let alone ten million times that. I agree that the propositions are very realistic and I personally find it hard to see the Green New Deal from the oppositions perspective, because I don't understand how you could be against saving our Earth, especially with a quality plan.

      <br><br>

I found the Bangladesh talk today quite scary, as it really shows the vast difference in our two countries. I also 1000% agree that since the US is screwing Bangladesh environmentally and they don't have the ability to protect themselves as well as we do, the US definitely should help out Bangladesh. And I totally support your idea that this would help promote economic growth in Bangladesh, and with that, a sustainable development of their country just like we have been talking in this class that third world countries need.




<br><hr>


I have the same feeling as you do. I feel hopeful when I see that there are finally some politics accessible people start to care about our environment and start trying to make some adjustments to our current existing economy structure. The Green New Deal is a good start. It mentions a lot of changes we can make in order to save the environment. Although some of the changes seem to be hardly approachable, it is necessary to take the first step of a whole series of changes. We will, of course, sacrifice a lot. The global value chain which has been developing for decades and finally reach a optimal state, but causes quite a significant amount of carbon emission, so we must make regulations opposing it. Food structure must change, and agriculture will contain a lower proportion of animal products. Industries that burn fossil fuels will also have to make a huge sacrifice, since fossil fuels are the main cause of carbon emission. A lot of people will lose their jobs. However, what is good about the Green New Deal is that it also mentions about ways that people can be compensated. Lower taxes on eco-friendly products will be imposed, and new job opportunities as well as education for these new jobs will be provided. 
      <br><br>
As one of the countries that has done the most amount of damage to the climate, the US should take the responsibility of starting the legislation of laws about the new economic structure. The status of the US in the world will allow this country to be the leader and pioneer of the new system. Moreover, the US is financially capable of carrying out these changes of the society and economic system. It has relatively more budget than other countries to compensate the loss. The United States is a country of liberty, which means the opinion of everyone in the country matters. Therefore, we should tell everyone around us how bad has the climate crisis is, and persuade them to become supporters of the Green New Deal.



<br><hr>

I think environmental justice is one of the most important topics that people fail to neglect in addressing the climate crisis however, it can make people feel incredibly out of touch with the issues or connect them even more to the challenges that we may face. I completely agree with youthat th e United States does have a responsibility to third world countries like Bangladesh. If we are going to be one of the biggest economic powers in the country and be one of the major trading partners with countries like Bangladesh, then we should be cognizant of the conditions there. For people who prioritize the economic incentives of sourcing all of our products from Bangladesh I believe that they should be concerned with the laws and conditions from where our products are coming from. And of course, for humanitarian reasons and honestly, human decency reasons, we are in a place of social and economic privilege to ensure that the laws in Bangladesh are protecting its workers. 
      <br><br>

However, if the United States wants to advise other countries and impose suggestions of better environmental and social laws for its workers, we should also lead by example. This is why I believe the Green New Deal is so instrumental to not only the climate crisis, but to fundamentally changing the foundation for which the United States supports our economic model for our workers. I appreciate the fact that the Green New Deal takes into account all environmental, social, and economic costs and impacts and that it clearly identifies vulnerable communities such as low-income and communities of color that we should not be adversely affecting any more.




<br><hr>

I completely agree with your statement about both the green new deal perhaps being the best way for people to benefit from while providing our environment with a sustainable way of living, and how the United states owes it to countries affected by our actions, such as Bangladesh. Within the Green New Deal reading, I found myself agreeing to many of the resolutions to reduce our own carbon footprint. As a a country who consumes the most energy, I find it that it is the U.S responsibility to the rest of the world and play a role in helping the countries that are negatively affected and suffering the consequences from our own mistake. I had the same thought of perhaps paying Bangladesh a good amount of money to fix building infrastructures, increase workers pay, and have them also switch to renewable energy. It's an important concept to achieve climate justice within countries like Bangladesh that are constantly exposed to dangerous and hazardous materials.




<br><hr>

I agree with you. When I saw the part Ken talked about the environmental issues in Bangladesh and how the US should take responsibilities in it, I felt deeply the same. It reminds me of CSR, the Corporate Social Responsibility. In places like Bangladesh, many developed countries like the US have set up factories that are creating pollution to the environment and providing a harsh working environment for local workers. These hurt the local people a lot, in many different ways. What’s more, they even have consequences like the fires that had happened in California, and those people have nothing to deal with, they simply don’t have enough resources. So I think the US should take responsibility in protecting the environment of the countries that have contracts with the US and change the way they live.

Hi Noah. I thought your comment touched on some really good points with the Green New Deal that I would like to dive into further and that are of great interest to me. First of all you touched a bit on why the Green New Deal mentions dollars of potential cost if we don’t do anything to mitigate climate change. I thought lines like this “a risk of damage to $1,000,000,000,000 of public infrastructure and coastal real estate in the United States;” and others really do the Green New deal a justice. It necessitates not just for moral or humanity sake we need to solve the climate crisis but for economic shake, and I think this will appeal to a very wide audience. I wrote a mini brief last quarter for my global warming class to Donald Trump talking about how much climate change will cost and hurt economic growth backed up with research and its insane! Even if economic growth is the number one priority (as some conservatives think), mitigating climate- change is in their favor. 
      <br><br>
 Noah you also mentioned the fact that social justice is a big focus of the Green New Deal and I am a huge fan that it is so. In my environmental ethics class we debated in order to get the Green New Deal past should the social justice part be taken out. And I say HELL NO. We, according to the GND, have the greatest income inequality since the 1920s! With a racial divide, a difference of “20 times more wealth between average white and black family”, we have the top 1% owning more wealth and the 3 billion poorest people in the world, we live in a world where as Ken mentioned obesity is our epidemic and overconsumption of food with so many malnourished and chronically hungry around the world (1 in 10 daily). We have one of the most horrific forms of inequality ever to exist, and climate change and the inequality it creates exacerbates this so much further. The most vulnerable and poorest communities are going to be impacted most by the effects of climate change. To not mitigating climate change is to reproduce inequality even further in our country and our globe. It disgusts me that in Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming they mention that it should be each countries job to assess their climate vulnerability. Are you f**king kidding me right now? They idiots need to watch Ken’s social justice video. If they could hear facts such as US 2.5 flights per year per person, Bangladesh 1 in 55 fly every year therefore US per capita on air travel is 14,000% greater than Bangladesh and automobiles 21,000% greater than in Bangladesh. We have contributed monumentally more to the crisis than any other developing country, and with this burning of fossil fuels that created our wealth and the crisis, we now have the wealth to better protect ourselves from climate change effects. Does this sound just to you? Per person we contribute way more to the crisis that will affect the poor areas way more than us and with our wealth we created burning fossil fuels we can protect ourselves so much better from climate disaster. What a joke of a country we are if we don’t commit to the Green New Deal in full and lead the world in a sustainable climate friendly economy.

I like how in the Green New Deal it says that "the United States must take a leading role in reducing emissions through economic transformation." This is very true, as the United States is a "model" country and a leader of the world. Having emitted so much of the greenhouse gases causing climate change makes it even more our responsibility to change our course of action and address this issue. With the leadership of the United States, other developing countries can also evolve to be more sustainable, climate-friendly countries that do not make the same mistakes that the US has been making. 
      <br><br>


"Degrowth" economically of developed countries is a great point brought up in the video that I loved. To make a change in the climate, we must change our relationship to the earth, to ourselves, to each other, and to money and materials. We need to "degrow" our material and economic system, which will in turn give us the time and resources to grow our love and happiness for each other and for the world. We can stop being consumed by materials and stop consuming our precious environment, and instead coexist further with each other and nature, bringing about a much better and happier world, respecting and coexisting peacefully with all other beings including our Mother Nature.

Watching "The Green New Deal" I had an inclination that I was perusing the future one might say. I was actually truly astounded and frustrated with myself at the same time about the way that I had never caught wind of this arrangement I feel like an arrangement this significant and this progressive ought to have made each feature, ought to have been communicated by each and every news outlet around the globe. It is important to comprehend that numerous individuals, particularly the President, don't concur with this arrangement. They believe that it won't work and will make the US economy plunge. I likewise concur with the idea of "degrowth" being a need for our way of life. This thought helps me with the film to remember moderation and causes me to comprehend that there isn't a lot of space for adding more to our general public. I'm just overall surprised of how oblivious I was.

I totally agree with what you’re saying. I also felt extremely shocked while reading the Green New Deal that I have never read it before. I remember hearing about it in history classes I took in high school, but I took the time to look into it completely and read each of the topics it discusses. The fact that I haven’t read much of it prior to being enrolled in this class, I know there must be so many people who have not and may never will read it for themselves. I agree with you that it should be something we, as the general public, should have been informed on the second this deal became public. The fact that people came together to create this deal, and that the information it contains is extremely vital, is why I feel slightly upset that the Green New Deal isn’t one that many have ever stopped to look into. 
      <br><br>

I also feel I should touch on what Ken brought up in this video, whether the U.S. should or shouldn’t be responsible for part of what’s happening in Bangladesh, because I feel strongly that we definitely should. In fact, I would be upset if we never do take some type of responsibility as we are the ones who created much of the negative aspects about that their environment they live in today.

For this week's reading, I had a lot of opinions. First off, I really appreciate how to document presents the harsh realities of anthropogenic climate change. Especially with this quote taken from the beginning of the document, "human activity is the dominant cause of observed climate change over the past century". It really makes me think, since humans are the ones to have caused all this damage, shouldn't we feel the most obligated to increase our efforts for climate change?
      <br><br>

The document later presents the many positives of implementing the Green New Deal, such include... "achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers, create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States..." and the list goes on.
      <br><br>
To the nonbeliever percentage of the population, these propositions might seem outlandish and too optimistic. However, in my opinion, I feel like the more outlandish it is, the more it will inspire people to act. Although I do find it a bit unfortunate that the Green New Deal lists incentives such as an increase in jobs and economic security as a strategy to convert non believers into believers, I still think the Green New Deal is a promising document and sparks inspiration and food for thought.

Back in my sixth grade year, I was living in Arlington, Virginia. The area is very nice, and very wealthy. One winter, there was a snow storm that was projected to bring feet of snow to the area, essentially shutting down the city. The local government decided that it would be unacceptable for this to happen, as business could not halt. Therefore, to battle the upcoming snowstorm, snow plows were strategically set up around the city, salt was being thrown out by the bucket onto the roads, water pipes were being temporarily emptied, and even some trees that had the potential to fall over near power lines were cut down to avoid such occurrence. When the snow finally came, it did not maintain its previous hype. Maybe two to three inches of snow fell, and it only stuck for about a half a day before melting off the streets. I bring this up to highlight one of Ken’s talk points in his video: money begets safety in terms of natural disaster. This stands out to me because it was not a reactive measure, but was essentially a preemptive strike against the local weather. To have the economic stability to safeguard against even possible minor inconveniences is simply stunning. 
      <br><br>

It becomes less inspiring, however, when it is compared to other areas, even other areas in the same country. Prior to living in Virginia, I lived in a tiny, dirt poor town in Upstate New York. I can recall one year I was in the car with my mom on the way to the store, when a white out hit. We stopped the car, and watched snow pile up alarmingly fast on the road in front of us. After waiting for a few hours, visibility regained and we quickly realized the car was not going to be moving. We got out, turned around, and walked a few miles back to the house. We couldn’t get the car out for another 5 days, as the town couldn’t afford a solid snow plowing system. Comparing this to Arlington, it’s kind of crazy to see how disparities in wealth can lead to such disparities in ability to mitigate disastrous weather patterns. Putting it on a global scale, this is even more true when comparing areas like Haiti to California in pertinence to earthquakes.

What I really appreciated about this lecture video was that it puts the whole class into perspective. Ken could’ve chosen to make a video breaking down the Green New Deal, its implications, and its contents. But instead, he chose to talk about the responsibility that the US has in passing the Green New Deal. By arguing that the US placed 25% of the carbon emissions into the atmosphere and that they have an obligation to fix it, Ken makes his audience reconsider the effects of the actions of the United States.
      <br><br>
The class has always focused on how harmful our behavior has been to the planet, but this is the first time that I have felt like our actions are truly impacting the people around us, in addition to the planet.
      <br><br>

By comparing our country to Bangladesh, Ken lets us see how our decisions will impact the rest of the world. When you consider the number of people in Bangladesh who own a car or have flown, and then compare that to their counterparts in the United States, you see that there is truly no comparison when it comes to the impact of the United States on the planet.
      <br><br>
In my opinion, this perspective lends a lot of credibility to the Green New Deal. Because the US is emitting so much of the carbon into the atmosphere, we owe it to the rest of the world to lead by example and take action. Ken argues in the video that wealthier companies are better equipped to protect their people and I think this perfectly encapsulates what I am trying to say. With policies like this one, the United States is able to take the first step towards protecting the planet as well as the people that we share the planet with.

This week we learned so much about the Green New Deal, of course reading it gives us a pretty good perspective but the additions from Vox and Ken helped put everything in perspective and make it even more digestible.  We have a huge responsibility to make sure this document is easily understandable to everyone and that it doesn't seem like liberals are trying to shove unfeasible business practices down the countries throat.  Whether or not that is the case, does't matter.  We have this massive obligation to put our pride aside and pull the shades back.  This makes me think of something Ken reminded us of very early on in the course.  Climate change is not decades in the making, but rather the bulk of it has occured in a single lifetime.  The timeline may have started as far back as the industrial revolution, but our predecssors are not our villians, we are our own villians.  The current business practices and cultural practices are the ones poisoning us.  The Green New Deal makes it best attempt at being that wake up call.  If we choose to blindy go about our day to day lives never questioning why we do the things we do and if the things we do are detrimental to the planet, we will one day be forced to wake up when we are far beyond the point of no return.  We are way past the point of reduce reuse recycle being sufficient practice to protect us from our own destruction.  We need serious dynamic change that may influence every aspect of our lives.  I hope we can wake up soon, as see how our world is designed to keep the average person complacent and engaged in the society being fed to us.  There is nothing stopping change, something just needs to spark it.  I dont know if it can be GND but it would be awesome if it could be.

I agree, I feel as though this video puts into perspective how much we affect the less wealthy countries around the world. Most of this class is indeed about our impact on the planet and how it'll affect us personally in the US, but this video definitely broadens that perspective leaving us to question the extent of the injustices our country is truly creating. I truly feel as though we do have an obligation to help other countries, like Bangladesh, because they did not ask for this and don't have the money to fix the issues themselves thus it is our responsibility to fix the problems we caused. We can't just throw this on them and say "screw you, we don't care." I also agree that approaching the Green New Deal from this perspective places more credibility surrounding it. The Green New Deal is not just to fix our problems, its to try and eliminate the external problems we have created globally as a consequent of our actions. We're supposed to be such a leader in the world, yet we don't even take care of the messes we make. I think it's definitely our time to reach out to developing countries and help them solve their environmental, social, and climate injustices. We have the resources, but do we have the basic empathy to care about other people in the world? It's time for us to stop being greedy, because inevitably it will come back to bite us since we reap what we sow.

After reading “The Green New Deal”, I feel like our future can be saved by some solutions. In the past, people put all their efforts in promoting the development of economics. However, they ignored the side effect it brought to human life, which is pollution, one of the biggest issues nowadays. Then, we must pay more money in protecting our environment now and in the future.
      <br><br>
The Green New Deal calls for the removal and replacement of carbon-based fuels with non-carbon-based fuels. This is important because the first step in stemming the damage of climate change is slowing, and eventually halting, the spewing of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Without such action, anything else is negligible. The Green New Deal proposes many ways to decarbonize our infrastructure, including retrofitting, reducing air travel, increasing food efficiency and transitioning to clean energy. Decarbonizing our economy is a noble goal, but not enough. Besides, we need the government to spend money, especially when we confront crises. Thus, tax revenue is essential. What’s more, we need a just transition. The Green New Deal is one of the most robust worker protections put forward in the past few decades. Our economy needs a massive shift in a new direction to avoid cataclysmic planetary catastrophe. But we need to make sure that we do not leave people behind.
      <br><br>
The Green New Deal requires an era of cooperation, innovation, knowledge-sharing, and capacity-building. It requires us to get out of our homes, into our communities, interact with people we do not interact with, be critical and be idealistic. It is extensive and comprehensive, waiting for us to fill in the details.

Before coming to this class, I was well aware of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her meteoric rise; she had become a well-known, and well-liked, name in my classrooms. Her legislation, the Green New Deal, was one that caused a lot of outrage when it first was announced. I agree with you that the Green New Deal offers a way to our futures, but I’m doubtful that it will actually be implemented. There seems to be too much hostility in government right now to ever pass anything that would cross party lines. However, if it is possible to implement, I believe it will go a long way in helping our planet.

I do agree with this statement and the information presented for the most part. The idea of our era and generation of people being able to be that cohesive unit to eventually save the planet to me is absolutely amazing and the answer to what we can do to fix this issue. I do think that saying we’re the only issue isn’t quite true and is used in a way to force this deal through. As we have observed in class and in other films like mentioned in this video, places like Bangladesh and China are mass producers in CO2 emissions, and I feel we as the US are not the only problem. Although, this does in fact make sense being it’s such an official document in fixing the US problem with CO2 emissions, and do agree with the claims and threats of this issue. It’s very direct in almost shocking and scaring the reader to realize the degree of the issue, then presenting positive ways and reasons to why we as the US needs to make these changes immediately.

I was shocked at some of the estimates in the Green New Deal. For instance, I didn’t realize that our economy could lose as much as half a billion dollars every year around 2100 due to the effects of climate change. That’s just absurd. I was also shocked to see the statistics that the average white family earns 20 times the wealth of the average black family. I had no idea it was that bad. I was pleasantly surprised by the resolution addressing the wealth inequality and that despite us working longer hours, we earn more money adjusted for inflation than we did 40-50 years ago. 
      <br><br>

I was again happy that they tried to address how we would go about fixing the inevitable consequences of changing our entire economy and infrastructure. I like how their goals are ones that align with what I think is right such as universal access to water, food, and health care. I also agree with better public transportation such as high speed railways that are so desperately needed on the West coast, and would help put a dent in our carbon footprint immediately. And lastly I really liked how they addressed ways to help preserve our ecosystems, animals, and soil. I think everything in the deal is doable but will take some time and a lot of effort and money to achieve. But I think it’s definitely possible and judging by what climate scientists say, needed.

One factor that isn't brought up nearly enough in these conversations about policy goals is whether that policy gets implemented. It doesn't matter that Bangladesh has an environmental director that can legally shut down any company that fails to comply with Bangladesh's strong theoretical environmental protections after a warning if in practice the director cannot actually stop any of these companies from polluting, or even get accurate results.

I have to agree with you on the fact that if there is no implementing of policies, these policies are just words on paper. The government’s job is to incorporate the policies that our representatives in congress come up with. An effective government is always going to be better than a big or small government. If the same effort that is put into tax collection or military spending was also put into climate related issues, these changes would be seamless. 
      <br><br>
I feel like the priorities of the various heads of government with the most strings to pull are nowhere near those of the next generation. When the next generation will need to implement self-sustainability just to avoid a deadly crisis. The individuals that gloss over the climate crisis will be the least effected.

<br><hr>
Jason Ouyang Your comment on policy implementation reminds me of when I studied the deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil for another class. On paper, there were relatively strong regulations on forest use and management. In reality though, many of these laws were not enforced and even knowingly broken by the current government. This is majorly due to the country’s president having a strong stance against acknowledging climate change. When you have a leader that doesn’t support the policy, it makes it extremely hard successfully implement.

In reading through “The Green New Deal,” I was surprised to find myself agreeing with most everything stated in a political document. Although I do not have much experience in analyzing such political deals/bills, the ones I have read I felt most conflicted about. In contrast, the statistics of this bill seemed to be very accurate like the listed effects of global warming at or above 2 degrees Celsius on the range of environments. However, what I was most surprised to be reading about was the in depth discussion of the economic impacts. Although I consider these negative impacts to be one of the lesser worries in comparison to the total destruction of the planet, I felt this was an extremely important addition to the bill. This is because many selfish or economically-focused politicians and citizens don’t pay much, if any, attention at all to the horrific effects of climate change. By speaking so much to the negative impacts that climate change will have on the economic state of the world and the specific economic solutions, the bill is able to attract the attention and support of those that may not have previously been reached by the climate crisis. We can already see companies supporting the change to renewable energy sources like solar panels tasting the economic advantages as more and more people make the switch and as the Green New Deal funds many of these jobs. Therefore, I feel that this bill is one of the more successfully written political documents I’ve seen, and I hope we will be able to follow along in accordance.

I agree with you in the fact that it was extremely important for the politicians who drafted this document to include the economic impacts of climate change. This may be the one way that the Republicans who do not endorse the fight against climate change will reevaluate their opinions. This document was carefully drafted to appeal to both political parties, as well as the rest of the population.


<br><hr>
I completely agree. I think this document is written in a manner that's a lot more understandable and easy to follow than other political documents I've had to read. I appreciate that because I feel like it makes this information a lot more accessible to anyone who's interested, not just politicians. I agree about the economic emphasis as well- I think it was a really smart strategic move to get the people who really only care about the dollars in their pockets to start thinking about/caring about climate change and finally viewing it as as climate crisis. I also think it was really powerful that they addressed environmental racism and the increased impact the climate crisis has on people of color, in particular indigenous communities. I really appreciated that because the only time I've ever heard people even acknowledge that environmental racism exists is here at UCSB- so it was really reassuring to know that there are politicians and people in higher positions of power than I am that know about it and want to work to stop it just as much as I do. This document gives me a lot of hope about the future of our country and of our world.



<br><hr>
I like that your comment specifically highlights the focal nature that economics have in the Green New Deal. The unfortunate truth in the context of climate change is that action will likely never be taken unless it causes great economic loss, either directly or indirectly, to the United States. Money pretty much runs the government, and so the only way that you can convince the government to ever take action towards an issue is once you bring economic effects into the equation. I think we would all like to believe that politicians and the government would implement a plan like the Green New Deal purely because of the fact they recognize the anthropogenic side of climate change, but in reality, it will always only boil down to what their constituents and/or donors want, or what does best for their economies. 
      <br><br>
I also agree with your perspective on the successful nature of how the document is written. The Green New Deal lays every policy out clearly with logical reasons and facts that back up the validity of each presented policy. Additionally, each policy covers many of the government's and many politician's most important issues (economic, environmental, cultural, etc), so the document has a well-balanced sense to it. It's concise and clear in what's happening to our Earth because of climate change, and how each newly-presented policy helps mitigate the policy's respective climate-related issue.

I totally agree with you. Although I don't know anything about political deals,  I still think  "The Green New Deal" is a big progress on climate, since we got a practical plan or syllabus. Even though I don't know the accuracy of the statistics in the deal, those numbers make me feel valid about this deal. What I was most surprised about the reading was the broadness of climate issues.  We can see that various aspects of society are related to the climate, including jobs, economy, race, etc. We can no longer limit our view only on pollution, like greenhouse gases. Many other perspectives are also needed to be considered, such as the consumer culture mentioned in class.  This reminds what my history teacher said before, "Everything is connected."  We need to think divergently for finding an effective method about the climate crisis. There is one sentence in the reading impressed me. "a Green New Deal must be developed through transparent and inclusive consultation, collaboration, and partnership with frontline and vulnerable communities, labor unions, worker cooperatives, civil society groups, academia, and businesses;" It is true that we need to stick together on the climate problem for preserve a better habitat for ourselves. Put away your comparison between personal profit and climate. The climate is your profit, our profit, human's profit.

I was very impressed with the actual substance of the Green New Deal. The first part of the Green New Deal describes what we have to do to fight the climate crisis. This includes reaching literally zero emissions. The first part is not revolutionary whatsoever; it is an honest and exact outline of what we need to do. However, the second part admits that the first part will be very challenging and it provides a way to transition between where we are right now and where we need to be without negatively affecting ordinary Americans. The 10-year program will ensure that the public is educated on the current climate situation. It will take into account Indigenous law. It will enact and enforce trade rules and standards. Most importantly, the Green New Deal will provide all Americans with health care, safe and affordable housing, economic security, clean water, clean air, and healthy and affordable food.

I am so grateful that I have been born into privilege, in an upper-middle-class family, in the United States, but I am also furious at the system that has given me that privilege. People are exploited every day to bolster our economy, our needs, and our strangest useless desires. And those people suffer not just in the creation process, but in mother nature's revenge. I am trying really hard to let go of the materialism I was taught from a young age, but that's not enough. I want to help people. I've heard people joke about environmentalists just wanting to kill off the human race, but that's not true. I am an environmentalist because I care about people. The issue here is, somehow providing relief to third-world countries is a lot more difficult than quitting fast fashion. What can I actually do? I can't drop my life and go help in person. I am a college kid, so I don't have money to donate. What is there left to do?
      <br><br>
Anyway, these are all reasons why you should vote. Vot e for humanitarians. Vote for people who actually can do something. That action is small, but its ripples can disrupt rivers.

When considering the climate crisis, I believe that the injustices should be more addressed. Why is it that very recently I learned about the injustices that include the social, environmental and the climate? Many times we are not taught about sea level rise or other natural disasters that occur in other places outside of the United States, and how these natural disasters affect the life of others. It makes me sad how the countries that contribute the least amount of green house gases are the most impacted by disasters and lack any protection. Why is it that about 40 million people across Bangladesh are starving? Why have we not reached out to provide the necessary tools and protection while people are dying? I believe that we should reach out to mitigate the social, climate, and injustice of it all. Apart from changing culturally by reducing our carbon footprint, I think that we should be an outreach by providing resources, and even the protection that many countries do not have. 
      <br><br>

Regarding the Green New Deal, I believe that it should be passed. This should not be a political issue, but rather should be passed to end the injustices and mitigate the climate crisis. The Green New Deal is effective in many ways, by focusing on clean water, jobs, safety and even supporting soil health. The Green New Deal addresses the importance and the impact that these environmental changes will have on us. I believe that the Green New Deal offers what we need in order to change our impact on the environment. We need to act on the issue before it is too late, and this resolution can change that.

After I watch ken’s video and the green new deal. I understood that every country has their policy or actions to solve each problem. It just let me remind me what my mother country China did to make me proud. China, as one of the biggest population nations, it solve the population problem with the policy set by the government. With the progress of the birth control, in the upcoming 50 years the environmental resource will be balanced and the pollution like carbon emission that people created will be decreased as well. Thus, with the safe control of the government, every countries environment will be getting better,

I appreciate how the resolution part reveals the consequences of climate change and how humans are the main cause of climate change from the past century. Some of these consequences involve us losing a lot of money, more heat stress, mass migration, intense wildfires, more than 99% of coral dead, etc. The resolution mentions how if we want to keep below 1.5 degrees celsius, we need to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 60% from 2010 to 2030 as well as have net-zero global emissions by 2050. However, since we are currently increasing our global greenhouse gas emissions, I wonder how much percent we would need to reduce by now until 2030. One of the frustrating things about this whole thing is that it is our own country that is causing most of this to happen, it is as if we hear reduction and decide to increase more and more. During the resolution, it mentioned how the US needs to do a lot of reduction through economic transformation. I’m hoping someone can please explain what they mean by economic transformation in this situation and what it would look like to them. Our constant increase of greenhouse gas emissions isn’t the US’ only problem that’s correlated to climate crisis. The US’ life expectancy and accessibility to basic needs are both declining. Also, it would be much appreciated if someone can clarify for me what “wage stagnation” meant in this context of this reading since it got brought up multiple times. I thought it was quite interesting how they brought up income inequalities in the resolution, it showed me that they are actually trying to use the zero emissions transitional period to improve the way we currently function by making changes to systemic mistakes. For instance, some income inequalities involve the top 1% getting 91% gains after the Great Recession, the average white family makes 20 times more than the average black family, and women make 80% of what men make. I also really appreciated how this resolution was explaining how the affects to things such as climate change, pollution, and environmental destruction weren’t just things that harmed our planet, but how they also harm us in a societal way by intensifying systemic racial, regional, social, environmental, and economic injustices. Beyond this, climate change is a national security threat to the US. Thankfully I was given a more detailed explanation on why it is a national security threat from President Obama in a past film for this class, otherwise I would have slightly struggled trying to connect the dots.
        <br><br>
  I’m not sure if others noticed, but this text at different times was truly trying to emphasize how it is the federal government’s responsibility to create a Green New Deal. They went more in detail of how the federal government was responsible for making sure that the Green New Deal creates millions of good,high-wage jobs; makes investments for our planet; net-zero emissions; and secure for all people: clean air and water; climate and community resiliency; healthy food; access to nature; and a sustainable environment; promote equity and justice stopping current, preventing future and repairing past things with vulnerable communities. I think it’s great that they acknowledge all of this won’t just happen in the blink of an eye, that it along with all other things, take time. In the resolution, they address that they have a 10 year mobilization plan to achieve these goals. Not only do they say they have this plan, but give a good layout to what this plan looks like. For example, repairing and upgrading infrastructure in the US by eliminating pollution and greenhouse gases if technologically feasible, access to clean water, reducing risks, infrastructure bills consider climate change when Congress decides whether to pass or not. I would assume that the “reducing risks” that they are referring to is health problems, for instance, heat stress. I like that the federal government doesn’t think it just has to be their voices heard, but also that they should work with farmers to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector. Other places where we can remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are from the transportation sector. Some of these transportation would entail zero-emission vehicles, clean/affordable/accessible public transit, and high speed rail. On top of restoring our societal problems during this transitional period, the resolution states how we should restore natural ecosystems. Within the text, I noticed that it states that the US should help other countries achieve a Green New Deal. Maybe it should be us learning a thing or two from other countries because what we are doing right now does not seem to be working, instead we are currently making the problem worse.

Selling the concept of "degrowth" will be very difficult. One of the most effective arguments against climate legislation is that it will adversely affect the economy. What people must realize is that degrowth is worth it when considering the alternatives of over $500,000,000,000 of lost economic output in the US, mass migrations, and the risk of $1,000,000,000,000 of damage to public infrastructure and coastal real estate. It is also interesting to note that many of these results from the climate crisis fall into categories that were ranked highly by the boomer generation. 
        <br><br>
Many of the cultural changes that need to take place are only problems for the first world. These first world problems that come with reducing one's carbon footprint are minuscule to the majority of the world. Most countries do not have their diets centralized around meats and somewhat consequently do not come close to matching the United States' obesity rate. If the first world would swallow its pride and accept these changes for a better future, they would also see that these changes will make them healthier and happier in the long run.

The "Green New Deal" reading was very informative to read. I am glad to see that the government and its approach to climate change. The article gave very good information about the problem and raises solutions to climate change through data and analysis. They give alternatives and resolutions to the changes and how the economy will be affected. I love they recognize the United States as one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and their solution to reducing the emissions is through economic transformation. The main concerns are for the generations to come to be able to secure them: clean air and water, climate and community resiliency, healthy food, access to nature, and a sustainable environment. If we really wanted to we could teach kids that in their prime of learning food consumptions and introducing them to plant-based so this is how they will eat. It is sad to see that politicians refuse to see this action plan because of how it will affect our economy. Reflecting on Ken's video, he brings up a good point about how the United States has the power and resources to fix our disasters but how is it possible we can keep causing them to happen. Like yeah, the United States can fix the cost of disasters but other poor and unwealthy countries struggle to fix these issues and they are not even the ones nearly contributing to climate change.

This was honestly one of my favorite lecture videos of the quarter. All the other ones have been topics that I've pretty much known about but this is the first vide where I can actually say that every piece of information that was presented to me had me actually thinking and realizing how much I don't know. Where I live we have fires pretty much all the time, but we would go from a fire one week to literal hail storm the next. If that isn't an indicator of how drastic climate change can affect us then I really don't know what else would convince you. It also goes to show that I never really thought about how bad those changes in the weather were till honestly just now. Another thing that had me thinking was the huge gap between the rich and the poor. Obviously I'm aware of that issue in the United States but it's a whole other level when you compare it with countries in the world. The fact that some of the poorest people on this planet are contributing so little to the climate crisis and are already facing the consequences is sickening and makes me honestly want to scream. Even if we just look at the United States, the rush prosper and successes of the backs of the poor and working class and if that isn't enough of a moral issue for some people then they need to step back and look at the effects the rich have on our climate.

Hi Olamide! I agree with you, reading this piece and watching this lecture video put a lot of new views into my head that I had not considered before. When Ken mentioned the Thomas Fire and you mentioned the large gap between the rich and the poor, it was very interesting to me because I had never really thought about how we were so lucky to have the resources and funds available to contain and put out that massive fire. It got me to think more about how if the global temperatures continue to go up and cause these massive natural disasters, many other places in the world would not have the resources to contain them. I feel very grateful that we are lucky enough to have these firefighters stop the Thomas Fire but it makes me so worried for the other people in the world. Reading the green new deal gave me hope because not only are they talking about solutions, but they are putting a time stamp on it and showing us ways to control this crisis not only for the planet and well being of humans, but for the economy as well.

After reading “Green New Deal”, I was shocked to see how much I didn’t know about the text. I had heard about the Green New Deal before, but I had never done much research on it until I had to read it now for this class. Reading this text made me hopeful knowing that people are out there actively trying to do something about the climate crisis instead of just talking about it. Nothing will ever get done if no one takes the initiative to come up with something like the Green New Deal to show people that there are ways of fixing the problem and making our world a better place. One thing I like about the Green New Deal is that they focus more on poor communities than the rich ones, making sure that the poor will not be affected. I find it extremely upsetting that the poor are for the most part the ones mostly affected by climate change even though it’s the wealthy that contribute more to it. I like that the text talks about what will happen if no action is taken and then talks about solutions for how to fix it. This ensures that people can see the big picture and understand why climate change is a problem and also see simultaneously that there are different ways to fix this problem.

I too did not realize how much I didn't know about the Green New Deal. I also liked how it mentions helping the more needy communities. They are the ones who will be affected the most by climate change and should be the ones wealthier places should protect because they do owe it to them. This reading made me have hope because it demonstrates that we can help put an end to this. The idea is there and the statistics as we've seen through this class show us that it is possible. All that is really needed now is our want. How much are we truly willing to give up in order to achieve a brighter future. I believe that we will be able to come together and better our future.

Throughout reading the Green New Deal, I went through numerous stages of hope contrasted with stages of extreme doubt. The Green New Deal lays out such a perfect, realistic, implementable plan, that it is hard not to believe that it could actually work. At the same time, when I compare it with the current state of the U.S. (hyper-consumeristic, anthropocentric, materialistic, unequal), I find it difficult to believe that this plan could work. I start to think about all the people in the United States who not only ignore the climate crisis, but those who are actively fighting against it, including some who hold positions of power in the government (*cough cough* the president *cough cough*). I start to wonder how we could possibly turn around the direction that our world is headed in when we have not even been able to solve issues that should have never existed in the first place, such as income inequality, racism, homophobia, and xenophobia (a short list of the numerous unacceptable issues in our society). Then, I started to realize: The Green New Deal was not made with the expectation that change would stem from society directly, but that we can change societal values and customs from the top down; aka, starting with the government. There is no way to get every American to follow the guidelines stated in the Green New Deal without there being some sort of push or incentive, which is exactly what the Green New Deal is aiming to achieve. By targeting the root of our issues, by changing governmental policies and federal laws and regulations, we can—in turn—change the way that our society functions. 
         <br><br>

This led me to recall one of Ken’s lectures from a few weeks ago, where he mentioned that the number one thing we can do to combat climate change is to VOTE. At the time, I found it a bit unfathomable that THAT was the biggest thing we could do to mitigate this crisis. However, I am now piecing together pieces of the puzzle, and in thinking about the Green New Deal, I realized that Ken is absolutely right. We should OF COURSE continue to decrease our personal carbon emissions through eating habits, buying habits, transportation habits, wasting habits, etc.; however, without enacting a MAJOR paradigm shift, we will not get as far as we need to in order to save our world from much worse destruction than it has already survived. We need those in power to support this movement, and the Green New Deal is a beyond exceptional start. It baffles me that it is not more widely publicized, but I am also not surprised, considering the numerous unimportant “problems” that political parties are so concerned about. By making an informed decision when voting in the presidential elections this upcoming November, we may finally have a chance at creating a new era; an era where inequality gaps start to narrow, carbon emissions drop close to zero, medical access becomes widespread and accessible, and the job market begins to prosper. This all begins with your vote, so make the right one.

This was an insightful video, especially from an economical standpoint. It shouldn't be news that the environmental dilemma that we face, as well as the many problems that we face on a social, cultural, and economic level is simply a leaf of the seed that is capitalism. Many seem to have this idea that the environmental plagues that are extensive greenhouse gas emissions can be dealt with without toppling down this very institution that is a direct proponent of the climate crisis. The economic system that gives agency to a select number of people and corporations to worsen the environment for their own interests must be questioned, and this begins with education of the public in order to effectively challenge these institutions. It is also the responsibility of the U.S. to be an example nation, as it holds great power and influence, but this can be unrealistic. The same capitalist system that feeds environmental degradation is the same one that our nation "thrives" under. Furthermore, it is purely unethical that though the U.S. is such a big part in the climate problem, the effects of this are felt far greater in other countries than our own. The worst part is that these countries often lack the facilities to solve a problem that they did not create. I was watching a video that documented the effects of the Exxon Mobil and Shell gas companies polluting third-world societies both environmentally and economically. In addition to pumping toxins in rivers and lakes, local jobs were put out of business and other businesses in the food sector were put out of commission as a result of the pollution which had destroyed many of their crops due to resultant fires and poisons. This is just one example of the many that go undocumented. The citizens of such countries live in much less luxury than in our own and we even add to their suffering from our culture of consumerism, yet many of these folk are much better advocates for our planet than we are.

The Green New Deal offers an effecting solution to the climate problem all the while being reasonable. I have heard of this idea before this class, but I never knew much about it, but I feel like this is something that everyone should be educated about. It is hard to grasp how this idea has not been adopted by many politicians, as it is a not only a solution the climate change that is affecting all of us, which is most evident through the recent climate catastrophes that have been ransacking America, but also it provides a solution to the socioeconomic and cultural crises that we face such as healthcare, classism and racism, education, working wages, and more.

This video and reading "The Green New Deal" really brought to my attention how privileged we are as a country. What we consider disaster here is the reality that people in less developed countries face on a day to day basis. I think the idea of degrowth is extremely important but I believe is highly unlikely because of our internalization of capitalism where more is always better. Our society always yearns for more money, more convenience, easier ways of doing things because it is what our economy was built on. However, we have a major responsibility to ensure the reduction of environmental destruction across the globe because of the role we have played in hurting so many countries for our benefit. It is time to pay our dues and do the humane thing -- to pay back what we owe these people.

         <br><br>

I never understood the capacity of our emergency response teams like firefighting has in comparison to other countries. When he mentions that the Thomas Fire cost hundred of millions of dollars to put out, I realized how better off we are. Should that fire have taken place in a different country, it had the ability to wipe out entire towns and kill so many people as well as the inability to rebuild and resettle. Huge destructive events like these is what contributes to the growing income gap across the world, because the people who are able to rebuild are the wealthy and doing that allows them to leave the poorer people behind and take greater control of the area economically, physically, and politically. What we need to do is focus on our collective rebuilding during these events and ensure we all have the same access to resources to reduce the divide between the poor and the wealthy.

I totally agree with you that "disasters" that occur in the United States are some poor people's common reality. Although in the last five years or so hurricanes and wildfires have done lots of damage to America, countries like Bangladesh suffer far more in general and far more frequently from natural catastrophes. I'm undoubtedly grateful that we generally respond to these disasters successfully, but it upsets me that some countries don't have sufficient resources to respond to events of this magnitude or greater; it upsets me even more that the cause of these life-threatening events are largely due to carbon emissions from the United States. It is not fair that countries who contribute almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions compared to developed countries like the U.S. suffer the greatest.

         <br><br>

One thing I thought about when Ken spoke about firefighters extinguishing the Thomas Fire was the compound effect of climate change. Excessive greenhouse gas emissions play a factor in wildfires that spread that play a factor in more greenhouse gasses being emitted because airplanes are used to put out the fires and firefighters from near and far must travel to stop the fire. It's already bad enough that wildfires are frequently raging at unprecedented rates, but it's even worse that carbon emissions are additionally increasing because of the transportation required to help combat them. 
         <br><br>


I admire your plan to ensure all countries have equal access to resources such as firefighting personnel and equipment, but these resources also further contribute to climate change. The utmost goal should be for the United States to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to better prevent the tragedies that occur in America and worldwide.

After reading “The Green New Deal” I was really motivated that we can make a change. As someone who is majoring in political science and hopes to go into law someday, I loved seeing the political aspect of the climate crisis. A bill such as “The Green New Deal” inspires change and shows that have the ability to lead the world in sustainability. I thought the bill was very strong, as it discussed the climate crisis, poverty, and inequality. It is refreshing to see people in politics who aren’t funded by big corporations or fossil fuel companies. 
          <br><br>

While I thought the bill was very strong, I definitely had many questions after reading it. I used to be an Economics major and I come from a conservative family, so I have grown up learning to question both sides. As I consider myself to be liberal and an environmentalist, I wanted to fully support this bill. Questions such as where this money is coming from though, stopped me slightly. While I think that having net zero emissions and using public transportation more than cars are both important ideas, I am not sure if it is fully realistic currently. Many people do not live in cities and travel long distances for school and work. With this, electric cars such as Teslas produce massive amounts of CO2 in manufacturing, making them not fully sustainable. Along with this, the bill mentioned keeping more manufacturing in the United States. While I completely agree, I find this hard to implement because companies rely on cheap labor. I hope we can move towards “The Green New Deal”, as I feel that it shows how desperately we need to address climate change. With that said, I believe more Americans would agree with the bill if more information was given.
          <br><br>

I thought Ken’s comments were very fitting, as it showed the privilege America holds. We must lead the planet in fixing our mess. I was shocked to learn that 40% of America is obese, while 1/10 people globally suffer from starvation. Since America has put so much CO2 into the atmosphere, we must fix it.

I totally agree with your comment and I too am wondering where the funding of such changes would come from. As positive and as inspiring as this bill sounds, it seems too good to be able to come true. Like you mention, the issue of money does make the reader react with concern. But with this negativity aside, it does sound revolutionary and necessary. This bill does a good job at pointing out everything wrong with human activity, as it deems human activity the dominant cause of observed climate change over the past century. I personally think that every person should read this bill as it underlines issues in regards to the climate crisis that some people may refuse to acknowledge or are just unaware of such as: rising oceans, increased temperatures, threats to human life and wildlife, mass migration, and national security issues. 
          <br><br>
Similar to you, I think Ken's comments are appropriate for the problem. America prides itself in being a leader and holding extensive power, yet is the one causing the most damage for the world. This bill also addresses the role that the US plays in this problem, as it argues the US must take a leading role in reducing emissions. I was surprised to read that life expectancy is declining while basic needs are becoming more and more inaccessible to a significant portion of the US. This, on top of the obesity and starvation that you mention, are destroying the human race, and yet those in power are doing nothing to address it. To touch on the questions that Ken poses at the end of this video, I think the US should immediately help the developed world address their issues of social, environmental, and climate injustices. Not only because the US has the tools to do so, but because we as a country create that mess, we are the ones who are making the developing world unable to come out of their struggles.

Abigail, I agree with your comment almost completely. It makes me glad to hear that you look and question both sides of the argument, that’s what we all should be doing. I agree that a deal should be put in place to protect our world from environmental damages and reduce greenhouse gases, but I am skeptical of the Green New Deal. As I read over the deal, I just don’t understand why some points are tied in with the main idea of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I understand that some economic transformations may need to occur for this deal to happen and that low income groups are the most heavily affected, but I’m still not sure why racial wealth divide and gender earning gaps are thrown in there. I guess as examples of income inequality, however I don’t believe that it is necessary to drag other topics like race into this issue. Climate change negatively affects all people all over the world. Yes, some more than others, like those in third world nations, but at the end of the day this issue affects us all. There are other details that also make me somewhat skeptical about this deal. It states that it is the duty of the federal government to create a Green New Deal, “to create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States.” Wow this sounds almost too good to be true. I feel like this statement is not only exaggerated but it might also be somewhat unrealistic. Of course it sounds great to say ‘let's create millions of good, high paying jobs’ because who’s going to argue with that? But to actually create specific guidelines and details as to what these jobs are and what people can get these jobs is completely different. 
          <br><br>
 Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against a deal that will protect our world from greenhouse gases, in fact I want to help reduce greenhouse gases and take great individual efforts to reduce my own CO2 emissions. And there are some points of the Green New Deal that are good. However, now that I’ve actually read over this deal, it seems somewhat vague and unspecific, and even unrealistic. As for Ken’s lecture video, I was amazed (like usual) at some of the numbers Ken states. Bangladesh's meat consumption per capita is 4 pounds per year, and Americas is 265 pounds per capita per year. I couldn’t even visualize that. And not to mention it contributes to our obesity epidemic. Again in Bangladesh, only 1/55 fly per year, compared to 2.5 flights per year per person. This is a great example of the inequality between first world and third world countries, especially because we as Americans contribute so much to CO2 emissions that harm countries like Bangladesh the most.



<br><Hr>
I think the green new deal looks amazing on paper and would undoubtedly help mitigate the damage caused by mass co2 emissions. The deal is of course very well planned and extremely compelling. The only problem, as you pointed out, is where the funding would come from. This is not just a small missing piece, this is absolutely necessary for the green new deal to be possible. 
          <br><br>
If the funding were to come from our taxes, im sure many more people would oppose it or at least not welcome it as openly as they currently do - without the money being talked about. 
          <br><br>


Regarding the question asked at the end of the video, I think America as a whole is in part responsible for other countries' current situations, like Bangladesh. It is not 100% the U.S fault but we did play a role in their economy and markets that cost many to lose their lives for our greed. That said, I am not too sure about what could be done now besides offering better wages to them. Im not an expert on fixing economies, but I think we do owe them something. If possible maybe the U.S could help set-up a similar Green New Deal Resolution in cooperation with other countries to get their economies going using environmentally friendly methods.

As a STEM major I can tend to lose focus on just how important it is to look at the climate crisis from multiple perspectives, which is one of the reasons I decided to take this class as well as English 22 last quarter. I get so lost in thinking about how science can play a role that I need to remind myself to take a step back and understand that no scientific change will be able to even be put into effect if there is not first political change that will approve it. As Ken has mentioned on multiple occasions, technology is not the only answer, we need sweeping cultural change, and part of that begins with policy change such as with The Green New Deal. It is so interesting to hear your perspective as a political science major (and a former economics major) because you are able to focus on details that I missed while reading “The Green New Deal” and bring them to the attention of people who might have focused on other details. There are so many facets to the climate crisis and as you mentioned, The Green New Deal talks about how poverty and inequality come to play in the climate crisis and how policy can help to resolve some issues such as how it could “[guarantee] a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.”
          <br><br>


I too struggle with understanding just how realistic The Green New Deal currently is, even with how much I want to completely and fully support it. While it is our best chance, it can be hard to wrap our heads around such a strong idea, mainly because we have never seen something like this before (at least that I am aware of) and it quite frankly seems a little too good to be true. But this mindset is exactly what republicans are banking on when it comes to voting, so it is our job to put more time into researching and understanding just how effective The Green New Deal could be, and how it will help us resolve such a pressing issue if we vote for it. As mentioned in another one of the videos this week, it is a possibility that The Green New Deal was kept somewhat vague in hopes of scaring off less people who would be unwilling to vote if they thought too much change would occur. There is definitely a balance that needs to be struck, but I do agree that more Americans would be willing to vote if there was more information provided. 
          <br><br>


I also really enjoyed that you mentioned how you come from a conservative family but personally have liberal views. So many people assume that everyone immediately adopts their families political views without question because that seems to be the easy, natural route, but I am glad to see that you and so many other people are challenging this. It is so important for people to exercise the amazing right to vote that so many of us are lucky to have here in America, and it is just as important that people exercise the right to adopt their own political viewpoints. As a country we have done a lot of harm to the planet, as was discussed in the video, and it is our job to fix this mess. While there is no true way to make up for us eating 6600% more meat than Bangladesh and wasting food that contributes to emissions while there are people that are starving across the world, The Green New Deal is a step in the right direction towards change.

I agree with your comment. The Green New Deal sets many goals and provides many ways to accomplish them. On the one hand, I think it is good to see some political actions in the climate crisis, and that they are going to reduce emissions through economic transformation; on the other hand, after reading it I feel like that there is an overwhelming amount of things that are urgent and need to be done asap, but some of them seems hard to achieve to me, such as achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and establishing millions of high-wage jobs and ensuring economic security for all. I appreciate that they accept the US as the leading role in the climate crisis, not just the developing countries. The Green New Deal is a revolutionary movement that pointed out the duty of the federal government and what should they do.

The Green New Deal sounds great and I’m all for it, and though it raised my fear of people losing their jobs, I’m glad the second part to it acknowledges that and offers a solution. The root of my fear is traced back to my dad losing his job late 2017 at a power plant as a gas engineer. He worked there for as long as I could remember, and when they let him off and shut down the power plant, the effects were devastating for his mental health and for my family. I’m so grateful to be able to attend a university in the first place. Anyways, when the Green New Deal talks about zero fossil fuels, I couldn’t help but think of the lower class people who worked in related jobs not because they have a choice or anything, but because it’s stable. Not the greedy corporate higher ups but the people below. I can feel assured that the Green New Deal directly addresses this, and when it hopefully comes into effect when Democrats take the house in 2020, families will be ok. It’s easy to come up with something like the Green New Deal as an older white guy with money to spare and forget the lives of other people who aren’t maybe as wealthy or stable, so for them to still acknowledge the working class and provide a swift transition brings me ease.

First of all, I agree with you. I think the green New Deal sounds great, but the problem is, it's too idealistic. When I read the Green New Deal, I thought it was a very effective policy to protect the environment. They did give me a fuller picture of the goals of the Green New Deal. We must act, but many people are divided. Progress is needed at all levels, personal, social and political. In some ways, the green New Deal promises to achieve this goal, but the problem with the Green New Deal is that it is so extreme that even if it were written into law, it would have disastrous consequences. The second part of the Green New Deal does address the most obvious of these problems, but unfortunately, it fails to address some of the possible outcomes. The green New Deal is too idealistic for the reality we live in. It assumes that people are kind, capable of uniting and want to change. But in fact, it's not that simple. Now society needs economic development, people want to earn more money, they have to consume resources to create wealth. To sum up, the Green New Deal has been effective in solving environmental problems in some ways, but it still needs some changes to make it feasible.

After reading the Green New Deal for this week, I did a little compare and contrast of the Green New Deal and the original New Deal proposed by Franklin Roosevelt, and I began to see the reasons that it is being called a green new deal. The reading shows a clear shift in emphasis from merely pushing for economic growth to the protection and conservation of our environment and limiting our carbon footprint on the planet. Plus, the Green New Deal also addresses social justice issues associated with climate change with its discussion on the impacts of climate change on the “frontline and vulnerable communities”, which is significant since the poor, third-world developing countries tend to have their voices ignored or drowned in the international organizations dominated by the wealthy powerful first-world developed countries. 
          <br><br>


As much as we dislike believing it, social inequality and injustices are extremely prevalent in our modern world and are shown through almost every single major societal issue, including climate change. To be perfectly honest, before taking this course, I never thought that social injustice instances can overlap with the climate crisis because they are two completely different areas to me and it seems improbable that each would have something to do with the other. However, after completing the assignments in this class thus far and listening to Ken’s lectures, I saw that social injustice has so much to do with climate change because it relates to environmental and climate injustice. Just as Ken mentioned in the lecture video for this week’s reading, the poor developing third-world countries have far less financial sources and support for them to face and deal with the consequences of climate change such as rapid sea level rise and frequent extreme weather events, yet they are the ones contributing the least amount of carbon emission into the atmosphere and to the problem of climate change in a whole. 
          <br><br>


This situation, if we come to think of it, is quite ironic because the wealthy countries are contributing a far greater amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and are much more blameworthy in worsening the conditions of climate change, and at the same time these wealthy powerful countries can somewhat get away with all the environmentally-harmful actions they have done due to their advanced technology and greater financial sources and international influences. The poor developing countries that almost virtually have nothing to do with causing the climate crisis as a result of their extremely low carbon emission per capita, low standard of life, and struggling economies are the ones being pushed to the frontline directly facing the horrifying consequences of the climate crisis mostly caused by the wealthy developed countries. Now I understand the reason those countries and their people are referred to as the “frontline and vulnerable communities” because they are literally being forced to be at the frontline when climate crisis hits and they are the most vulnerable people on the planet because they do not have the same amount of wealth and advanced technology to protect their people from the destruction of climate change. 

          <br><br>

In response to Ken’s questions at the end of the video, I think that the wealthy first-world developed countries such as the U.S. and Europe should take on a leadership role in leading the world to combat climate change because they have the responsibilities and capabilities to do so. Since those countries are the main ones causing climate change, then it would only make sense for them to take remedial actions to mitigate this crisis they started. Also, these countries have the wealth and technology to mitigate the climate crisis with their well-developed economies compared to the poor developing countries. It would be unjust and unreasonable to make the poor developing countries to face the problem of climate change alone because they are not largely held accountable for initiating this crisis and they are not equipped with the wealth and resources to mitigate climate change on themselves. All in all, the U.S. and other developed countries should step in and help the poor developing countries in their struggle with climate change because the developed countries have the duty and the abilities to do so.

Ken did a great job in showing how wide of an impact the US has when it comes to the climate crisis as we are a leading developed country in the world who has had their “American Dream” of excessive growth and consumerism exported around the world.  Seeing as the US leads in many terrible emissions, I think it definitely complies with social justice, environmental justice, and climate justice to not only make changes within our country, but also help others with issues that they are having.  Therefore, I think that it is very important to adopt the Green New Deal.  We must change our country and right our decades of wrongs when it comes to unsustainable habits and growth.  Changing our country can also help cause change in other countries as the US can lead by example in becoming a much more environmentally conscious country.  At the same time, it is also important to help those other countries advance their changes as we do so that industries in the US, such as the fast fashion industry, can no longer exploit other countries as it is cheaper and there are much less regulations regarding workers, the environment, and the overall quality of life.
          <br><br>

The changes that need to be made around the world would be most effective if they were done simultaneously so that all at once the world could move towards a more sustainable tomorrow, however changes does have to start somewhere and people must advocate it.  For the US, we currently have the Green New Deal that has been developed, so now we must put it into practice.  Once we do that we can figure out exactly what works and what doesn’t work so that we are then able to effectively help other countries.  Also, while the people who created the Green New Deal and many throughout the US support it, there needs to be more in order to get it passed into law.  This means those who already support it must educate others to increase support and help our country be the change we need to see in the world.

I agree that Ken successfully conveys the worrisome impact the United States had on the world’s climate crisis and emphasizes the importance of the Green New Deal in regards to how we as a country are responsible for social, environmental, and climate injustices. 
          <br><br>
I share your feelings of responsibility when I think about other countries that are suffering under far worse circumstances as a result of many American’s selfish ideas and lack of concern for the environment. Our unsustainable habits--which are for the most part completely in our control--are the reason that our country has historically been responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions. These are consequences that will impact nations across the planet and I find it shameful and disheartening that most US industries--especially that exploit other countries for work--are aware of this. I agree that these changes would be most effective if the effort was made simultaneously and that advocacy is an important step in that process. Raising awareness is a stepping stone in making sure it is known that our planet may become uninhabitable.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. First of all, the US likes to claim that they are the defender of justice and whatnot, so it would be very fitting for the US to take the lead in saving the planet. Second of all, the US is the main cause of the devastation we are causing to the planet. The US made it a standard to burn fossil fuels and popularized the idea of consumerism. We have led everyone to believe that our system is the best and should, therefore, serve as a model. So many other developing worlds are looking at our false representation of happiness in our media and see that we are the richest country and want to imitate that. However, the American Dream is simply a lie and entirely unachievable. The US has to take a stand in the Climate issue by using the Green New Deal as the first step to improvement. I don't think there is any other country more capable of making the necessary changes than the US. We have the money and resources so we should use it for the greater good. Although it has been deeply rooted in our culture to carry out environmentally terrible practices (which were enforced by the government), I know that it is possible to change even if it takes a while to completely become "carbon-free".  What the US also has to understand, is that we are viewed as an inspiration to other countries not just because we have "succeeded" but also because we act like the "hero." Even though there have been many times where the US made very bad choices, there have also been times where we really made a difference and helped others. So that being said, the US needs to start fixing their mistakes and actually do something relevant to the climate crisis. The Green New Deal is perfect in that it states clearly what the problem is and what we will have to do to amend it, it also recognizes the possible devastating effects it could have on regular people (oil workers and others with jobs in that sector). I think it will be a good first step, but we will need actual laws and systemic changes. Once, the US starts down the path, it will serve as a beacon of hope for other countries and will show that you don't need to destroy the planet to be a successful nation.



<br><hr>
I completely agree that the US should set an example for the rest of the world with the Green New Deal. If we could promote American ideals and culture globally in the past, it is possible to do it again but for more ethical reasons relating to climate justice. I like the fact that Ken frames his class around the social change required to mitigate the climate crisis, which is different from many approaches that are more scientific. It is extremely important to consider the impacts our actions have on people living in the developing world because people are suffering now - climate change isn’t just a problem for the future. In order to work towards climate justice around the world, we must also change our policies regarding businesses exploiting foreign laborers. Liveable wages and working conditions in developing countries would help to avoid tragedies such as the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh. Stricter laws on foreign investment can also reduce the environmental consequences of industries, such as polluted rivers and cleared forests.

I think that when it comes to the future, we have to prioritize the restructuring of America’s economy and infrastructure before we can start thinking about the assistance and reparations of third world countries. If we overcome the climate crisis and come out on the other end successful enough to start thinking about that kind of thing, it would definitely be fair to claim that the U.S. and other countries owe a certain debt to those most horribly affected by the emissions we have released. For the time being, it’s necessary that U.S. industries remove their dangerous factories from these countries and invest in domestic economic growth, or at least create respectable working conditions and wages for those who work in the factories. It will also be necessary for the U.S. to be prepared for the incoming wave of migration that will come as natural disasters in third world countries become more frequent and severe, causing a surge of climate refugees coming to the United States. Clearly, denying these refugees entry to the country is not a viable solution to a problem we have caused. Since climate change is an international crisis, it will require foreign policy that reflects its nature. In the future, an “America First” policy is just not going to work. Americans should not have to deal with the crisis alone, and shouldn’t leave less capable countries to do the same.

The United States has amazing potential to change. As we are recognized, self-proclaimed or otherwise, as a global leader, we have great influence on the future of the Earth and its inhabitants. We have a systemic problem of developmental superiority, which fuels our economics, policies, and social behavior. The US has power to change if it chooses, though the perpetuation of the system is maintained by those who are benefiting from the current system. As individuals, we should be asking ourselves, “Whose interest is this in?” as well as “What are the consequences of this?”.
          <br><br>

From an environmental perspective, the United States could be a champion of climate change, the vanguard country that serves as an architect and pioneer of the future should we choose.
          <br><br>

Currently, the United States operates as a capitalist neoliberal society, which is essentially a free global market system with massive transnational institutions. In such a system, underdeveloped countries’ well-being, such as Bangladesh’s, will be overlooked, even waived, when developed countries’ economic motives are at play. This is known as the Dependency Theory; the core, or developed countries, thrive off the exploitation of the periphery, or less developed countries. Exploitation can take many shapes, including natural resources, women, children, laborers, indigenous peoples, and others highlighted in the Green New Deal as “frontline and vulnerable communities”. Thus, the US has been intervening in other countries for as long as this structure has been in place, about 40 to 50 years. We need to change the way we intervene and respect these communities.
          <br><br>

It seems that our prosperity depends on the exploitation of others. This is due to our profit-driven belief that progress and growth are linear; linear systems on a cyclic Earth are not sustainable, especially the energy intensive and wasteful ones. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. Prior to capitalism, we operated under various other systems including mercantilism, feudalism, and tribalism, so it is possible to change; if the US were to forge a new path in a different direction, others would follow.

While I am not suggesting we look solely to the past and readopt tribalism, we can learn from it and adopt some of its methods. For instance, it is possible to invest in fair trade with an emphasis on moving and sharing wealth in a reciprocal, permacultural manner rather than an aggressive accumulative one that thrives on taking advantage of others. We can no longer operate within the same system and hope for improvement.
          <br><br>

Therefore, we must create a new system by shifting our motives from economic prosperity to the global well-being of the people and creatures on this planet. This can be achieved by funding foreign projects that specifically target environmental and climate improvement, providing aid for the disasters that occur due to climate change that the US has majorly contributed to, and offering asylum to climate refugees to name a few.
          <br><br>

As a world leader, we need to take responsibility for our actions since we have stripped the power away from others that may hold us accountable. We have caused these problems, so we need to pilot fixing them in a positive, respectful way.

I totally agree that the United States has created an economic epidemic for global trade. By nature the people in power are looking for the most efficient way to profit off of another, and that is through global exploitation. We enforce trade deals on  under served nations to cripple them into becoming solely reliant on our nation's exports while  we benefit off of cheap imports. It is a vicious, deadly cycle that may have some short-term benefits for the United States but will ultimately cripple any future trade once it reaches the tipping point of total economic collapse for that nation. 
          <br><br>

In a sense, we have become the apex predator for global economics. We look for new prey and enslave anything that comes into sight, that is capitalism. We should be promoting a fair-trade system that allows another country to mutually benefit without the long-term fallout. Every underdeveloped nation will jump at the chance for improving the living conditions and economic welfare of their citizens; the prospect of new jobs, better transportation, agricultural developments and better healthcare! I mean, who wouldn't jump at the chance to save their people and develop a brighter future. However, this future is hidden behind a glamorous diamond-studded curtain; behind the curtain lies shackles waiting to be attached. It is a sad gruesome truth of developing trade deals with other nations. I don't know if there is a viable solution, besides holding a coup d'é·tat
          <br><br>
 changing up the current heads of our government. I don't see any global change occurring for a longtime.

<br><hr>

What a great response. Reading this gave me even more insight on the topic at hand, so thank you for the information. I completely agree that the United States has power. It has so much power that if we could figure out how to reduce our emissions and start on the pathway towards a better more environmentally friendly pathway, we could be very successful. Not only could we just be successful in this endeavor, but we could pave the pathway and set an example for other countries to follow. As you said the United states could be the champion of climate change and as a pioneer for the future, I could not agree with this statement more. 
          <br><br>
The problem is we are stuck. We are stuck in this two-party system that can’t listen to one another. We are in a place where people choose a certain stance on climate change and activism because it aligns with a certain political party view. In order to make a change we need the climate crisis to rise up and become a bigger issue than a political party issue. We need everyone on board.
          <br><br>
Not only do we have a destructive two-party system that we use, but as you said it is almost as if we exploit others, often in less developed countries for the benefit of ourselves. It really stood out to me when you discussed the linear profit driven system. It is true, linear systems are not sustainable on earth, not when it comes to profit, not when it comes to sustainability. In order to change the trajectory of the earth that we are traveling down we need to rework our thinking. We need to come up with a cyclic renewable system. We need to stope exploiting developing countries for profit and start working with them to come up with a way for us to live sustainably. 
          <br><br>
As you mentioned we need to shift our motives form economic prosperity to the global well-being of people and this incredible earth. The only way to start on this trajectory is to start with action such as the Green New Deal. Once we are able to do that, we start taking the action to achieve these goals and move quickly to more and sustainable future that advocated for the environment and well-being of people and away from pure economic growth.

In the previous classes, I learned what an individual can do to reduce the emission of CO2. However, the deeper I know about the climate crisis, the more I realize that it is not enough to deal with the problem if we fight it as a person. The government has to take actions because some problem is so huge that no single person can address. For instance, the beef industry and the use of renewable energy, such as wind and solar. I learned a concept in economics called a negative externality, which refers to an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. Admittedly, we have to bear some costs in order to gain a higher quality of life, but too much pollution will be harm. Without government intervention, firms won't care about the environmental damage caused by production, because it is not their loss (in the short-run). I think the new green deal is vital since it gathers the power of each individual and let us work as a whole. Thus, the whole country and even the world will benefit. Besides, each country can set laws based on its own situation. Like the statistic mentioned in the video: American eats more beef than Bangladesh do. I believe that targeted solutions can solve problems more efficiently, so we can reach our goal in a shorter time.

After reading "The Green New Deal," I've learned that I still have a long way to go to truly know what is going when it comes to the environment and global warming. I thought that all I needed to know was how much carbon gas was being emitted into the air and that we needed to do something. But I never deeply thought enough to the point where I asked myself "How?" From the reading, I learned that the government legislation is finding a way to help our planet while being economically sufficient. The United States is the leading country that is trying to take the steps that are necessary toward saving the planet. And for once, I actually feel hopeful that we can truly help our environment. For weeks, I felt really hopeless and pessimistic because I felt as if I learned only about the horrible aspects of global warming and how people (especially Americans) contributed to this contamination. But now, I feel safer because it seems like we truly do have a plan for this ongoing disaster.

I feel the same way. Before I red the “The green new deal”, I only know about the statistics of carbon emissions and the possible solution to reduce it. All I think is that the solutions sounds good but it seems hard to achieve. Now, after I read it, I know that the solution people proposed are not just words. The government is processing to save our earth. The frequent fire or storms has already warned us that the earth has been badly influenced by us, and we should take the actions soon. The reading has gave us the hope that the earth are now cared by people.

As an aspiring public defender, it's always interesting to see how these laws (or, well, resolutions) are written. The beginnings of these legislative pieces of work are a bit funny in how they seem to soapbox for a moment at the beginning. Of course, it's necessary-- you have to prime and frame, set the stage for what the bill or resolution is actually going to be about-- and it's certainly nice to get a bit of "here's why we're doing this." 
          <br><br>

I really do like the substance of this resolution. It really does combine climate issues intersectionally with everything else; it shows how vital it is that we do not separate housing or water or food from climate, because at their core these things are intrinsically linked. If the climate changes too fully, we will not be able to eat, and if we want to save the climate we have to eat differently, and so the resolution makes sure we understand such a thing. And it's not, in any way, too long or droning. It would be hard for it to drone on without any specific policy proposals, no red tape to get itself bound down in. But it still makes efficient use of time and space. 
          <br><br>

I don't really have.. too much more to add on the GND, really. I love what it's inspired; I love how it was a great way to set the stage for far more radical and comprehensive future plans for how to truly change how our economy and country work. It's already done its purpose, and I'm glad to have it as a launching pad.

The “Green New Deal” gives me hope but at the same time, I’m sad that we have come to the point where we need this proposal. I like how before stating any resolutions, it gives us facts about the current condition of our planet. Everyone knows that human activity is the dominant cause of observed climate change over the past century, but it’s reassuring seeing it stated so officially in a proposal like this. Being in this class, I have learned a lot about our planet’s current situation, so reading the facts in the first part of the Green New Deal came as no surprise. What shocked me was the fact that more than 350,000,000 more people will be exposed globally to deadly heat stress by 2050. This is an insanely huge number and I can’t imagine this many people suffering in the near decades. I know for a fact that climate change will affect people in third world countries first which is so unfair considering that these countries have produced less than 5% of the carbon emissions in our atmosphere right now. 
          <br><br>


I really hope that these proposals go into effect and soon. Not only will this encourage our country to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in fair ways, it will create millions of good, high-wage jobs, ensuring prosperity and economic security for everyone in the United States. These resolutions sound amazing on paper but I would love to see them in action. Even if all these resolutions don’t go into action, we are taking a step in the right direction by addressing where we went wrong and what we need to do for the health of our planet, people, and animals. We got ourselves into this mess in the first place, so it is our responsibility to fix this.

I, also, was extremely disheartened thinking about how such a sweeping and intense environmental proposal is our last resort for saving our decaying planet. While it is discouraging to read about the huge hole we have dug ourselves into, it is also reassuring to know that someone in a representative position drafted this proposal. It reminds me that there are political figures out there that fully comprehend the irreversible damage we have done and acknowledge anthropogenic climate change as a fact. In addition to increased heat stress, the strong likelihood of deadlier flooding fills me with fear and heartbreak for the future of vulnerable populations in undeveloped countries like Bangladesh. It is unimaginable that every year, 5 thousand people are killed and 7 million homes are destroyed by flooding damage, an occurrence that has swept up to 75% of the country in the worst cases. Knowing that climate change effects are accelerating annually, it would make me hope that our country in a position of privilege, would be there for Bangladesh even more because they experience heightened disasters. However, I was disgusted to hear that the Trump Administration slashed funds to Bangladesh by 2/3 the amount of the previous administration in 2018. 
          <br><br>

Gathering off-putting evidence like that fuels my passion for replacing our current administration with more environmentally progressive individuals. I enjoyed consuming all of the information and measures outlined in the Green New Deal, as it is allowing me to get informed on the side of politics I support, and will advocate for, as well as educate my family and friends on.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you in the sense that it is a shame that we let such issues escalate when we have had the power and equipment needed to combat climate change for quite a while now. The Green New Deal is definitely a game changer and is a huge breath of fresh air,  but leave it to the senate (which is crawling with conservatives) to shut down this proposition. I hate to be that guy, but going back to the movie "A Climate of Doubt,' politicians have made climate change a bipartisan issue, so the likeliness of this proposition going into full effect is unfortunately very slim. Putting all negativity aside, I am very hopeful that this bill will be the one exception and help fight the crisis and system injustices. 
          <br><br>

Although I have learned many statistics in regards to the causes and impact of the climate crisis since the beginning of this class, this proposition still was able to surprise me with the statistics that they introduced. For instance, the fact that having the global temperature at or above 2 degrees Celsius can risk damaging public infrastructure at the cost of 1 trillion dollars had me dumbfounded. If all politicians were aware of the economic issues that the climate crisis will negatively bring upon this nation, they would easily agree to combat it. By producing electricity through sustainable sources, the government could easily save millions in the long run, even though it would cost a lot to implement such projects. The most interesting and amazing aspect of this proposition is the inclusion of ideas to combat system justices and to support frontline and vulnerable communities. Hopefully the Green New Deal gets passed by both the house and senate so this nation can finally change for the better.

The Green New Deal was exactly what I thought it was. I knew that it deals with America and not only the environment but also injustice. While comparing it to Bangladesh as Ken did, it is obvious how much we take for granted. When he stated how much more meat we eat compared to developing countries I was completely disgusted. Although, this might come from my own view on meat and not find it appetizing. But what scares me is that we continue to eat this much meat, when there are great amounts of people in other countries that are starving. Where is the Green New Deal for countries like Bangladesh? They can’t afford to pay for the stuff required to have safe working conditions while we are decreasing our funding to them. There is no reason to cut our funding to Bangladesh when they are in clear need of our help. The Green New Deal could be put into place to help build jobs and make America a more sustainable country while we fund Bangladesh to do the same. The amount of poverty in these third world countries could be decreased if we would step in as a country.

The two things I appreciated the most about this bill were as follows: first, the fact they were willing to take responsibility for the US’s role in the climate crisis rather than blame developing countries, and second, the focus on protecting indigenous people. Many republican senators claim that US makes up only a small fraction of the world's CO2 and thus we shouldn’t sacrifice economic growth to help the environment. They love pointing to India and China as examples of countries who are abusing the environment worse than us. What they fail to acknowledge is that the reason they pollute so much is because we offshore production to China and make them manufacture for us. AOC accepts the US’s role in the climate crisis and chooses to take it head on, even if we need to embrace “degrowth”. However, this doesn’t mean people will be losing jobs, because the Green New Deal, similar to FDR’s new deal will put millions to work. manufacturing wind turbines, millions of workers will lead the transition to a new economy. The jobs created must be “high-road, union jobs: with family-sustaining wages and benefits, safe working conditions, and training and advancement opportunities.” Even further, A Green New Deal would help working class families decrease their energy bills and reduce their transit costs by offering more “energy-efficient homes, access to affordable wind and solar power, and more reliable options for affordable public transportation.”
          <br><br>
When it comes to grand expenditures such as a Green New Deal, it's easy to overlook the problems faced by minorities. From the perspective of a house representative, native americans are an incredibly small fraction of their constituency, yet AOC still chooses to specifically address how to address their needs. One of the issues with democracy is that it’s so easy to focus on the majority and ignore the minority, which is why we need people like AOC to stand up for their rights. Not only will this bill help indigenous people who are continually pushed off their land for oil pipelines, but will help many people of color who predominantly live in urban areas with many health hazards.

I also found that it made me very appreciative to know that the US is accepting responsibility for its role in greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. It is not often that we see this happen, specially since our current president does not believe in climate change. I completely agree with what you are saying about the US always blaming other developing countries for the climate crisis we are in right now. I think that if anything, the US should first figure out what we can do in our own country in order to help the environment, before going and putting the blame on other countries and telling them that they should change. I find it very infuriating when the government decides that the environment is not as important as the economy. Like you mentioned, republican politicians believe that economic growth should not be sacrificed for the well-being of our environment. However, I do not think that they realize that it doesn't matter in what state our economy is, if we have completely trashed our planet and made in unlivable. I think that it is very important for social and environmental justice to take place, specially in developing countries, not only for the well-being of our environment, but also for the well-being of all the people that live there.

Hi Evan,
          <br><br>
I also think it is important for the US to take responsibility for its role in the climate crisis instead of blaming developing countries. The US is the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases (only second to China who, like you said, is high in greenhouse gas emissions because the United States’s offshore production and manufacturing to China), and therefore, needs to be held responsible for the situation that the planet is in today and, on top of that, to take charge in the movement to curb climate change. This starts, in my opinion, through the US implementing legislation (like the Green New Deal) that sets an example for other nations on how to successfully alleviate greenhouse gas emissions. I also agree with you that we should protect indigenous people and minorities. The United States is a democracy and because of this, the majority will always beat out the minority. The problem with this is that the population of the United States is more than 300 million so the minority in America is not a small group but rather millions of people. Millions of people are getting negatively affected by the government and not having their voices heard. It is commendable that AOC is addressing their needs.



<br><hr>
I also appreciated that The Green New Deal admits that the United States plays a major role in the climate crisis. I thought it was important that they provided this information and also took into account the damage our country is causing. They mention many extreme weather events that are affecting the communities and also bring the important issue of this effecting vulnerable communities. The focus on improving our economy while controlling CO2 emissions seems promising as they mention there will be many new opportunities.I like that you also mentioned the issue of focusing on the majority rather than the minority groups. I think along with The Green New Deal, there are many challenges put on by the main focus.




<br><hr>

Evan, your two appreciative aspects greatly aligned with mine. The house representatives that made the bill realized how important it is that the United States take on the climate crisis as a world leader. As it states in the resolution, it is the duty of the federal government to address an issue that can impact the entire nation and world so drastically. These impacts have already been seen through the substantial weather changes, natural disasters, etc. I am glad that while this resolution has not passed yet, there are at least a major portion of the people's representatives that recognize just how drastic of an issue that the climate crisis proposes. The bill directly addresses the fact that the United States has to take responsibility for it's actions, proposing things such as to achieve net-zero global emissions by 2050. Of course, the rest of the world has a role as well, but as a world leader and such a major contributor to the climate issue, the United States is put in a very important position that allows for the possibility to become the change that is needed to turned around or at least slow down the climate crisis.  I am also glad that the bill addresses how indigenous people and other minorities have so much less when it comes to the climate crisis compared to the 1%. It's not like the climate crisis is able to pick and choose who or what it affects. It is obvious and continually stated that poorer people are much more disproportionately affected by the change than the ones that helped encourage the majority of the issue. For that, bills like the Green New Deal are important in reacquiring and cementing the US as a world leader and proprietor for change.

I find the policies of the Green New Deal interesting with it’s ultimately global impact. Within a course such as this one, I’ve seen many overlaps within another course, that being Comparative Politics. The social stance that countries described as ‘advanced democracies’ are highly looked upon and are comparatively modeled by others. They have the opportunity to create lasting and impactful environmental change, that as a result may further the agendas pushed in regard to social and political issues, although are unwilling in part to subsidies, and business/political interests. Also mentioned in AOC’s video, I found her inclusion of a campaign funded by public investment an interesting inclusion, as that’s what in part is further halting climate policy implementation. Admittedly, the outlines for an overhaul such as this are strict and they ultimately hurt a lot of people in the short run, but also provide a planet in which we can continue to inhabit. A lot of interest groups behind halting legislation such as the Green New Deal are acting in their own self interest and rightfully so, we as a nation do the same. But with such pressing environmental issues, it’s incredibly important that we do the same first here domestically and continue to serve as the role model we wish to see for others. (the issue of the US as the ‘right’ and only model is an interesting debate within itself - largely in part that we ourselves CAN learn from others and should be implementing changes for the future).

Although in some of his previous videos Ken has discussed climate injustice and the fact that the countries who have contributed most to the climate crisis are also the ones who are the most protected from its consequences, I didn’t understand the extent of this until he used the Thomas fire example in this video. In the past few years, California has experienced quite a few large wildfires and we thankfully had the resources to prevent most of them from doing major damage to civilization. It is crazy to think of the amount of destruction even one of these fires could do to a developing country, which does not have nearly as many resources as we do, let alone multiple. Moreover, the unfortunate reality is that if we do not start taking action against the climate crisis, developing countries will definitely be experiencing large natural disasters like this and at a frequent rate. There is no way that these countries will be able to get the resources to effectively fight these the way that we are so lucky to be able to do so. So even though these are the countries that have made the least contributions to the climate crisis, they will be the ones to suffer the most, while we stay relatively much more shielded from the consequences of our actions.

          <br><br>

 

Looking at the situation from this perspective, it seems like America has almost a moral obligation to help these developing countries, considering their problems will have been caused by us. However, considering our very self-centered view of the world, it seems very unlikely that we will take accountability for the problems of these third world countries, and they will most likely have to suffer through them alone.

Reading over the green new deal, I came to understand why it was so controversial despite its noble cause and intentions. I like how the resolution didn’t hold back or beat around the bush. The article makes clear on what will happen if nothing’s done and what the government must do to mitigate the consequences. What really stood out to me was the recognition that the green new deal will bring about radical changes which may harm a considerable portion of Americans. Rather than ignoring this aspect of radical environmental changes, the green new deal actually proposes logical and seemingly practical solutions to that problem. 

          <br><br>

While it’s encouraging and inspiring to see the green new deal take such a firm and strong stance on climate change, I can’t help but recognize how divisive it is. The policies have economic implications which most people wouldn’t be comfortable with. No way are republicans going to support any versions of the green new deal. Additionally, it doesn’t even have the full support of the democrats who aren’t progressive. With so much opposition, the green new deal, despite it great ideas, will have very limited success navigating American politics.

After reading the text this week,  I found the resolution approach to be alarming. It showcases reports that are supported by different research and data. The text delved into different methods and alternatives that we should do to secure for all people all around the world to get inspiration and information on where to start in tackling this environmental issue. In addition, I also believe that it is a good start for humanity to have a ‘blue-print’ or something to map out what is really going on in the climate crisis and how we are able to combat it. As the text highlights as being the first cause, “human activity is the dominant cause of observed climate change over the past century” . This is crucial in solving the climate crisis issue and probably the worst one to admit. As seen throughout the lecture, this is probably the hardest issue to deal with just because we feel uncomfortable to point the blame towards the issue of the climate crisis. Instead, most people, specifically our leaders, believe that this issue is a hoax and that it is a normal thing for our planet to go in a cycle that repairs and destroys itself. Overall, I found this house-resolution for the climate crisis to be just all data and methods that ‘we should do’, not enough data regarding what ‘we are currently doing’ in response to the climate crisis.

Ken, you brought up the concept that the U.S. has a "responsibility" in Bangladesh or other countries around the world to mitigate the damage that we have caused through climate destruction - I thought it was painfully ironic to hear that phrasing, because the idea of responsibility has been used so often to justify military intervention in the Middle East. It's frustrating to see infantilizing and imperial connotations thrust onto a word that has such powerful meaning in the context of an issue that is U.S.-born, in the climate crisis. It's frustrating because the fossil fuel-influenced wars in the Middle East are contributing to the real issue of responsibility - the climate injustice that the U.S. continues to perpetuate internationally and domestically.

          <br><br>

I think there's no question that we have international responsibility - it's basic decency to clean up after yourself, that's something most people know (though, let it be noted, not my housemates). We should do whatever it takes to at least "do no harm", internationally. After that, I hope that we could lead in working internationally to help build sustainable energy systems in developing countries, though it seems more than a bit hypocritical to take that step while our home is in its current state.

<p>
Reading the "Green New Deal" made me a almost bit optimistic, because we have seen how a lot of our government and political officials don't  really put too much importance into the environmental climate crisis, but in this reading I was able to see how they are going about mitigating the effects on our current solution and climate epidemic. Not only that, but how much we can do to truly make a change. It shows me how privileged we are as a country, in comparison to Bangladesh; it's pretty mind boggling how we can 6600% more meat than the average citizen in Bangladesh. This reading and this video (response lecture) really made me think about all the things we have available in comparison to other countries, in terms of resources and stability in the average citizen and just overall the stability of a country. The Green New Deal is the first step forward into a great change in not only America, but the world. The US being a major world-wide powerhouse in most things, should lead this change, inspiring others.

The “Green New Deal” is quite a unique piece of resolution. While I understand it is still a work-in-progress, I believe that actually benefits this deal. It shows that it is subject to change based on the needs of people and the environment as both are constantly changing. The way in which it is formatted is easy to read and understand, unlike some other bills/resolutions that are proposed. By starting with facts and proposed projections to our society and environment, the resolution shows that what is to follow is necessary to stopping further destruction. And everything that follows already accounts for so many people and problems. Those who constructed this resolution clearly have the best interest of all people in mind. They understand that switching over to zero emissions will affect lots of people, and they are doing their best to ensure that people still have jobs, can maintain a good standard of living, and are cared for. It shows that they are thinking about all angles to this, and are putting in a great deal of effort to do it in the best way possible, and that should mean something to everyone. It is amazing how short this resolution is, but how many problems it so accurately and clearly addresses. I really do hope that this resolution gets passed, and is not looked upon negatively (although that is almost sure to happen due to politics). It gives me hope that our government can make significant changes to helping us and the environment, and show people who disagree with it that it is not trying to control our lives or ruin our society, but rather that the government is responsible for all people and ensuring the livelihood of all who live here. We need the government to act on this as a whole to allow these changes to get implemented smoothly. If this gets passed it would be a historic resolution, one that I am proud to support.

I agree I was shocked by how straight forward and concise the structure of the "Green New Deal" was. The intentions come off as trying to better the country and increase equality. Degrowth is an interesting concept because we have been sucked into this black hole of greed as a country. I think what needs to be reflected on is what kind of growth we want and what that should like for everyone and for the planet as a whole. Not just how can everything be as convenient as possible, but how can everything thrive as much as possible. I am so curious about how many people outside of a political career has read the new green deal. Strong opinions are associated with it, but I am genuinely just curious about who has actually read it.

When Ken was discussing the amount of money it took to put out the Thomas Fire I was blown away. It is such a clear way to communicate the privilege we have especially compared to other countries. We are the main causes of a problem and ignore it because it will harm us least or ultimately just last. Thinking about how much water, food, and resources we waste and abuse just too comfortable and disconnect from the natural is crazy. Especially when people argue that it is natural for people to eat meat I always get confused because no other country is eating this much meat and there is nothing natural about our animal agriculture.

This was very different with bringing up justice and the overall epitome of the video. Like Ken said we need to address this as a huge problem. Renewable energy sources will be viable for poorer countries and should be easy to obtain for them. Bangladesh eats so much meat and it makes no sense how thats even possible but whats ridiculous is that the U.S eats 66% more meat. So many people own cars and it makes no sense either because people, need to find better solutions such as public transportation or even carpool. If Uber can create a better system where they also can carpool people who use them and lower the prices of the fares with cars that are fully electric that would help a lot too. Thomas fire was actually a huge deal and there are brush fires several times a year especially in California and there needs to be a better way to address these problems. The Climate crisis is causing all this.

There must some of the inefficient use of the resource. For example, too much spending on the military and too much spending on the execution process are questions resolvable. The money saved from those two questions can be used in education and other aspects. However, there are a lot of issues are not resolvable. For example, without the remarkable decrease in the cost of new energy technology, nobody can popularize the use of new energy in order to replace fossil fuels. If the government or some organization just forced it. It will become an around disaster. 

          <br><br>

To educate more people is the solution to benefit the human in both economically and environmentally.  However, most of the solution is either hurt the human economically or environmentally. Thus, in most situations, people need to give up one aspect or restrain their desire.

In the reading, “The GreenNew Deal”, I was able to gain understanding of how the United States legislation is attempting to improve climate change and emphasize different ways to improve the economy. It was very informative to distinguish what ways they are trying to improve the economy and improve climate change. It encourages me when they want to improve the economy and climate conditions. They are aiming to improve air conditions and severe conditions that we are hopefully not going to face. In  addition, it is also overwhelming when we see the predictions on how the world is going to end up if we don’t improve our lifestyle and actions. It was interesting how the “...more than 350,000,000 more people will be exposed globally to deadly heat stress by 2050; and (F) a risk of damage to $1,000,000,000,000 of public infrastructure and coastal real estate”. This is  very frightening but also informative, so we can have an idea how the world is going to be if we don’t improve and change our\ actions. Any small action can improve something ginormous.This encourage ourselves to reflect on our habits and actions and try to change in any simple way we can. As well, if many people are being more aware of the “The Great New Deal”, there are more positive changes being made to  help sustain our economy.

I can relate to this. I also learned a lot from this paper. Before taking this class, I did not even know what the green new deal was since I wasn’t very aware about the climate crisis either. I think that the fact that the green new deal mentions how they want to improve the economy is great. What is even better is that it wants to equally improve it for all. I feel that implementing renewable sources of energy is the way to go. It will create more efficient and sustainable sources of energy. Moreover, it will create a clean source of energy that is affordable to people. , Making this renewable energy change would also require a lot of help from workers. This will lead to the creation of new jobs as stated in the green new deal. These workers will also be trained to work which is pretty awesome. This can also help transition workers from the fossil fuel industry into a new working force which can help enhance this positive change. A change is important because like ken said, there’s a percentage of people which are the nonhealthy parts of world that will suffer from the consequences of climate change. Therefore, by making this change we can help prevent that.

When I was reading through the Green New Deal, a couple things surprised me. I fully expected to go through and just read a bunch of things regarding our climate footprint and how to reduce it. While this was definitely mentioned, the article went into great depth about other topics such as socioeconomic inequality, oppression of minority groups, and the gender pay gap. I thought this was significant for as we have learned throughout this course, it is often the minority groups that are most effected by our environmental actions. By highlighting this in the text, it makes this issue bigger than simply the environment. This is likely to get more interest and support out of Americans, which will hopefully lead to more action. I think this is a good step in the right direction, and hopefully we can stick to the goals listed within the document, unlike we have been able to do in the past.

I really agree with what you have to say. Like you, I simply expected a bunch of legislation jargon and overall climate change problems and overarching topics. The use of additional examples that you mentioned such as the pay gap and socioeconomic inequality are very powerful and as you said, significant. It gives the problem that is climate change a deeper meaning which makes the description of the deal a lot more powerful.


<br><hr>
I fully agree with you, I also started reading this article expecting it to just talk about ways to reduce our carbon footprint in ways we have heard before. However, once I read how the federal government recognizes its role in shaping how we respond to the climate change crisis in a way that takes social, environmental, and climate justice into consideration, I was very proud. Throughout the reading, a quote stated, “Whereas climate change, pollution, and environmental destruction have exacerbated systemic racial, regional, social, environmental, and economic injustices by disproportionately affecting indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, the poor, low-income workers...” I found this quote very accurate because I have personally witnessed and lived through these systemic injustices. Back home I grew up in a neighborhood that is considered “poor” and “dangerous” since the majority of the people are of color and “low-income workers”. For example, when there is heavy rain and storms, the streets get insanely flooded due to the lack of proper tools, resources, and weak infrastructures. One day the flooding got so bad around our house that my sister called some authorities for some sandbags and in the end we didn't receive any help because they thought the flooding wasn’t that bad. However, if we go around the rich cities around us such as Beverly Hills, sandbags and other tools are put up to protect the people from the flooding. This is when I knew there was a serious regional and social injustice even though we’re experiencing the same thing. As climate change gets worse, this and many other injustices will just increase over time. I have some hope that the Green New Deal will unite all of us as one to battle climate change together rather than abandoning people to suffer the consequences alone.




<br><hr>
Similarly, I also was shocked at how something like the Green New Deal actually mentions environmental racism and injustice and how minority groups like POC and low income folks are most affected by this. The Green New Deal was also very easy to read and I did not expect that at all. I was expecting to read a bunch of fancy words I don't know but it was straightforward and clear to understand which makes it more accessible. I also wanted to acknowledge this quote from the Green New Deal that states "ensuring that frontline and vulnerable communities shall not be adversely affected". This quote stood means a lot to me because I come from a inner city that is surrounded by factories (Vernon) and the amount of lead, premature deaths, bad air quality (which is finally on the weather app for iphones lol after years), waking up to rotten pig flesh thanks to farmer johns etc. are things no one should ever have to experience. The most vulnerable communities are being affected and have been suffering this for a long time. It is so frustrating having to hear that this is a fact over and over again yet no action is being done by those in power because they don't care about minorities. The Green New Deal was nice to read because it really lists all the things that are wrong and should be fixed but I guess I'm just so disillusioned that as I read it I couldn't help but feel like it won't be taken seriously due to other officials who don't care.

You're comment and perspective are almost exactly aligned with my own. The Green New Deal is undoubtedly one of the most publicized and recognized plans of legislation involving the climate crisis today, yet I too assumed that the components of the plan and solution were limited only to carbon emissions, and "climate footprint" as mentioned above. The Green New Deal's integration of social and economic inequalities, discrimination of minorities, and gender discrepancies/discrimination took me very much so by surprise. What I highlighted, and what was most compelling about your comment is definitely your discussion about how the less fortunate, minority and oppressed groups are (and will be) the most impacted from the advances and spread of the climate crisis. I believe it is important to recognize the climate crisis as a cross-sectional issue, effecting everyone on very very different levels. A failure to recognize the climate as a social, economic, environmental, and human issue, will take us farther away from our intentions to solve and alleviate this problem.

I feel like this reading and this video did a great job at calling out and drawing attention to our privilege as Americans. They successfully compare what many of us see as disaster to what many people in other countries consider everyday life. We are so privileged and lucky to have the resources that we have when disaster does strike, but this does not mean that we should ignore the millions of people that do not have these resources. I feel like Americans have a horrible habit of thinking that we are the only people on the planet, and this really needs to stop. I think that the idea of degrowth is very important and that it would be a great place to start with all of these issues. However, I have very little faith in America and I believe that it is very unrealistic for this to occur in such a consumer-based society. It is time for us, as a country, to start taking responsibility for all of the problems that we have caused. We can no longer reap the benefits that come with CO2 emissions, while forcing developing countries to deal with the consequences.

I have constantly heard of the Green New Deal ever since it started making its rounds to people of all political parties, and I have seen videos pertaining to it, but I have never gotten the chance to actually read anything from the document itself. I regret that I hadn’t read it sooner, however, because it reaffirmed everything we’ve been learning about and wanting to change. Things such as how the United States specifically is responsible for an excessive amount of greenhouse gas emissions and therefore should be the country leading the fight for lowered emissions is something I heavily agree with and have referenced a few times in my previous comments on Ken’s videos. Ken’s video this week was also insightful, especially with the contrasting statistics between the US and Bangladesh. I know many people are apprehensive about the Green New Deal solely due to worries about how we will pay for all of these ambitious solutions, but I feel like it’s not impossible to achieve.

<p>
The green new deal is such an easy reading piece to comprehend. I thought that the new deal would have a lot of parts to its that was hard to understand. But honestly everything that the reading said was vague which made sense. This deal would just be the beginning of something that has the potential to be really good for the planet.  This deal would deal with the US. This deal would start with the US and that is where we need to start because the US is such a huge part of the climate change problem.  I like that this deal as vague as it is addressing the fact the human activity is what has accelerated climate change.  This deal could potentially be the start of something new and good. It really astonishes me that so many people are against this deal. As Ken said in the video, this deal would help and would call for cultural change. This consumerism culture, wasting and consuming so much meat needs to stop. 
          <br><br>
As ken says in the video the US is going to have a such a hard time to change their cultural and end our disasters’ life styles. The develop world needs to make these cultural changes because we are the ones hurting the world the most. When I heard that 40 million people in Bangladesh are starving is so crazy and heartbreaking because there is so much food here in the US that goes to waste daily. Environmental injustices is the exact world that I would use to describe what places like Bangladesh goes through because of the greed the rich developed countries want. US is a huge responsibility to the world and Bangladesh. The US is such a huge contributor to the climate crisis and to environmental injustices.

Prior to reading “The Green New Deal” I was only partly familiar with this congressional resolution to the climate crisis.  However, after reading this and taking the class, I felt far more familiar with the ways in which the government proposes to go about mitigating the effects of the climate crisis.  I was most interested in finally learning more about the political efforts that are framed around the climate crisis in order to encourage people to make definite changes to their lifestyles.  Although the Green New Deal is quite controversial in many parts of America, it is ultimately a step forward in dealing with the great effects that are ravaging our Earth on a daily basis.  The ways in which the Green New Deal strategically breaks down the proper steps the government will take to improve the conditions in the environment is incredibly informative and is very hopeful for future legislations.  
          <br><br>


In response to Ken’s questions about the responsibilities of the U.S. in preventing the worsening conditions of the climate crisis, I believe we must take more actions than any other country in mitigating the effects of the climate crisis.  Because of our destructive behaviors driven by consumer culture, we are blinded by the constant greed that is the cause of many other countries’ sufferings. We should not only take full responsibility for this by acknowledging our destructive behaviors, but actually take the proper actions in mitigating the effects through legislation like the Green New Deal.

I completely agree that the Green New Deal has potential to be the first big step towards change, but to be frank, I don't believe that we'll ever reach a point within our lifetimes where politicians back down and collectively decide that climate change should be a focal point in a discussion. I feel hopeless at times when I think about how the possibility for change is literally at our fingertips and already formulated into a plan and we still are at the point where we can't actually implement anything. There are still people our age who don't believe in climate change at all, and it's terrifying to know that the planet will be in shambles due to their decisions if they outweigh our voices. I think that it's entirely the US's responsibility to prevent the world from a worse state of climate change since we ultimately are making the largest difference in the amount of carbon emissions produced. Everyday, there are more countries moving towards a greener future, especially places like Iceland, which Ken mentioned in a previous lecture, and the United States seems to be standing still, if not moving backwards. 

          <br><br>

I was familiar with the Green New Deal's premise beforehand. After reading about it, I was even more convinced that it was the way to go for the nation. However, I fear that our stone headed politicians making decisions in congress and the white house won't allow for that to happen.


<br><Hr>
I agree. I feel like the Green New Deal gave lots of people hope that something could be done about climate change. However, it is clear that more legislation must be passed if we want these things to become reality. Since we cause so much of the greenhouse gas emissions compared to other countries, we have a responsibility to do something about it. If we don't do anything, then countries like Bangladesh will continue to suffer.

My previous knowledge of the Green New Deal was that one of the youngest elected representatives, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, took immediate action when taking office by proposing the Green New Deal. Besides this I was not aware of the specific details that the Green New Deal was proposing before the reading, but after I was rather surprised for a number of reasons.
          <br><br>
The introduction of the bill firmly puts blame on the Federal Government incompetence when identifying and taking actions of the climate crisis before reaching dangerous degrees as we are currently facing; therefore, the bill’s essential purpose is to set guidelines and boundaries that the government has to adhere by. I found this factor to be rather an interesting approach because usually bills are proposed with the aim to be implemented by the government onto the people but, this time around, it's the people voting to enforce the bill onto the federal government. 
          <br><br>
Besides the bold introduction, the entire structure of the bill made it easy to comprehend what, why, and how. If dissected, the bill opens with the causes of the climate crisis which is due to human activity and then it lists the number of effects ranging from 99% loss of Earth’s coral reef to 350,000,000 exposed to deadly heat stress by 2050. The importance to address the problem is categorized as a threat to national security because the climate crisis had the capacity to negatively impact the economy, the environment, and social stability. Therefore, the responsibility to take charge of the crisis falls onto the federal government because as one of the main countries causing climate change, they owe it to the people to provide clean air, healthy food, and a sustainable environment (as mentioned in the bill). After outlining the cause, effect, and reasons for taking action, the bill goes on to set fourteen approaches the federal government can choose from in order to limit greenhouse gas emissions. One that I strongly believe should be implemented is 100% of power demanded coming from renewable energy, because as we have discussed in class, the fossil fuel industry has been the leading cause of the majority of carbon dioxide emission brought about in the U.S. Thereby, by eliminating one of the main contributors of climate change, the U.S is then taking the necessary measures to combat the crisis. 
          <br><br>
Overall, the structure of the bill is so that the people understand why the Green New Deal has to be approved and in order to do so it must be supported by the people by means of voting in support.

After reading  the "Green New Deal" and watching this video I come to realize how spoiled we are as a country. Our ways have really impacted other countries and yet we don't do much to change the fact. As professor Hiltner points out we eat so much more meat than some other countries. The cost of producing all this really impacts the Earth all around not just the countries that cause these problems. Growing up with the habits I have formed, are a lot easier to say that I will stop dead in my tracks rather than acting on those, but I think are necessary to do. To answer Professor Hiltner's question, should we help Bangladesh, we should by trying to change our way of living.

While reading the Green New Deal, I found myself agreeing to address our economic, social, and environmental issues, such as creating millions of jobs, achieving zero net emissions, investing in the prevention of climate change-related events, and practicing climate adaptability. I also found that I was asking a lot of "how to do it". This Green New Deal is like an outline of what happens when we take seriously and work together to make it work. I'm not entirely sure if this plan can convince me if I am a politician, I want to know how we will make it work and how we will save the planet without disrupting society, but honestly, I believe that is will happen. Politicians have been waiting to take action because they are afraid to lose their supporters and their donors, but now they need to change, which will be hell for many, but this is the consequence we must deal with. We must be responsible for putting the planet in its current critical state. What I like about this plan is that it looks easy, workable, and meaningful. I also like that a lot of them talk about economic security, and many people worry about whether this problem will be abolished. We spend a lot of time talking about our environmental impact on the planet, but we forget that some people unfortunately do work there, whether or not they have to choose, they must be taken care of.

Firstly, thank you Ken for not doubling up on Green New Deal informational videos. I enjoyed how you tied this video into justice and global responses to energy re-consumption, because after watching this video I have realized that it is these facts will tug on the heartstrings on those who have not fully committed themselves to be proponents of environmental safeguarding. I was curious in week 2 what the exact consequences for developing nations would be, so I found this portion of your lecture incredibly helpful. 
          <br><br>


The fact that Americans eat 66 per hundred per percent more beef than citizens of Bangladesh is flabbergasting, to say the least. And even more, that 40% of the entire country falls within the categories of hunger, starvation, or chronic starvation was absolutely outrageous. I used to think these issues circumventing environmental crisis boiled down to politics and financial capacity, but it is beginning to be more clear that by choosing to not adhere to environmentally safe consumption patterns, you are being complicit in committing injustice acts against countries that cannot help themselves.

I felt really upset after hearing about the extensive amount of CO2 emissions that the US is adding into the atmosphere compared to Bangladesh’s minimal (in comparison) amounts. At the same time, I’m glad that Ken used statistics (like how, for example, the per capita air travel in the US is 14,000% greater than in Bangladesh) because they truly depict the reality of the situation instead of just saying “America is contributing much more to greenhouse gas emissions compared to Bangladesh” which wouldn’t really show how bad the situation is. Ken also specified that a part of the problem for the developed world is that we will have to use less energy while, for the developing world, the problem will be just the opposite, which is something that we as a society (in America) have to keep in mind. We need to reduce our energy consumption while also working with the developing world to help them increase their energy consumption. The truth of the matter is that developing countries need our (developed countries) help and we, as privileged societies, need to recognize and act on this. 
          <br><br>

Let’s look at a few more statistics: 
          <br><br>
In the US, there are 2.5 flights per person
          <br><br>
In Bangladesh, just 1 in 55 people fly every year.
          <br><br>
In Bangladesh, only 4 people in a thousand own a car.
          <br><br>
There is dependable data showing how people in Bangladesh emit way, way less greenhouse gases compared to people in America. This should be enough to convince the developed economies of the world (like Great Britain, America, Germany, etc.) to start caring more about the more underdeveloped countries because, if we don’t begin to change now, we will soon be too late to make a change at all. I feel like most people in America rarely ever think about how their specific actions affect people on the other side of the globe but, honestly, that’s been a significant problem in our society for a while now, even within our own families: being too selfish and valuing capitalism over family, friends, and the well-being of others around you. If we look at the divorce rates and the amount of children who complain about their parents being too tired from their job to ever spend time with them, it's easy to see how America’s capitalism has made being overworked a norm (and over-consumption is just its by-product).

I wanted to respond to your comment because I was also very shocked and disappointed at learning about the US and their contribution to CO2 emissions. I was also particularly shocked at learning that in the US, air travel is 14,000% higher than in Bangladesh. I think that this statistic is an excellent example as to why we in the US need to change our cultural habits. We have become such consumers of all the resources available to us. While simultaneously not considering the dangers or injustice of it all. I agree that with you and Ken that the US needs to reduce our emissions while helping other developing countries increase consumption in an environmentally efficient way. I like how you laid out the statistics to really show the contrast between our cultures. I think that it excellently highlights the disparity between the US and a developing country like Bangladesh. It’s undeniable at this point to say that we are not a direct cause of the crazy amount of CO2 that has been pushed into the atmosphere. Finally I wanted to point out that I think you are right to say that our consumption is a byproduct of capitalism. I honestly hadn’t made that specific connection so I appreciate this post! I agree that our capitalist society has contributed to our emotional distance and caring for others. Just because we don’t see all the devastation and hardships in other countries does not mean its not happening. Even more our consumer culture, as we learned in the film “The True Cost”, has been the reason for hardship in Bangladesh. 
           <br><br>


In response to Ken’s question I definitely think we have a responsibility to other places in the world like Bangladesh. As you pointed out so clearly we are the ones contributing the most to the problem and hurting the least. However, as things get worse that will most likely change. Like Ken has made clear with the ever growing dangerous of wild fires in California. I think we owe it to them to help make strong environmental laws that will benefit their country. This would force a cultural shift in the US regarding are terrible habit of consumption. Though this may cause us to spend more money on a shirt I think this is exactly the type of change that will fix the cultural habits here in the US as well as fix the injustice that is occurring in Bangladesh.


<br><hr>
This is why I hope everyone votes for the Green New Deal because I feel like it is a perfect step in the right direction. Not only would we be taking responsibility for our emission of so much greenhouse gases, but we would also be taking action in aiding and hopefully stopping the climate crisis on a huger scale. I hope the concept of degrowth isn't disapproved of quickly; it is only a small sacrifice we have to make compared to all that we contributed to in harming the planet and those less fortunate who live in it too. The Green New Deal would be great for developing countries. I think it provides a great balance helping them increase their consumption while lowering ours. We do so much in excess. I think it's time we become accustomed to moderation and share with the world. I love the emphasis you put on Bangladesh because America needs to see the crazy comparison and truth those numbers tell. In voting for the Green New Deal we would be taking an important first step in taking responsibility for our actions.

After reading this article, I found that the green new deal is a comprehensive plan to curb the environmental damage caused by the United States, but I still doubt his purpose, because I don't know if this is a way for politicians to accumulate their own achievements. But he has had some positive effects, even though its main controversy will eventually come from American politics, which does come up with many good ideas about sustainable agriculture, reducing carbon emissions, and helping people get jobs with their living wages after changes in energy use. The overall proposal on paper seems promising in the area of environment and social justice, as it aims to help the poor, ensure access to clean water for all and create more jobs to strengthen the workforce. However, if this action is implemented, I am not sure whether it is effective, first of all, because I don't know whether it can be implemented in a short period of time, because even if a new legal provision is enacted in this country, it will take years of deliberation and such a huge project will be more difficult. Secondly, because I think the companies and senior managers who destroy the environment will try to bypass these regulations and still try to exploit workers and destroy the earth. We, as people, must hold them accountable if they try to override the law. Sadly, we don't have that much influence as ordinary people.

The "Green New Deal" is definitely a step in the right direction. I feel like it was very important for them to include not only the issues that we face during this climate crisis, but also to include goals that we can take action towards as well as the potential protections that will be provided to U.S. citizens if passed. I also think it was important to specify the actions that Americans can take because we have to understand that, as Ken mentioned in this video, the United States is so much more responsible for the Climate Crisis and CO2 emissions than any developing country. It's scary to think about how most republicans do not "agree" with this Green New Deal and see it as radical, because in reality it is one of the only ways we can stop ourselves from experiencing so many natural disasters.I still have hope that with this next election the right people will enter office and we might be able to bring the Green New Deal into practice. I think as a nation we owe it to the rest of the world to take responsibility for our choices and fully commit to having a more green and environmentally driven economy and existence. However, I think we should stay out of the policies of other countries like Bangladesh and focus on what WE can do ourselves.

In the reading “The Green New Deal,” I have a thorough understanding of Green New Deal legislation. It emphasizes the critical role that the US contributes to climate crises. In this video, Ken introduces the different problems faced by different countries according to their situation. He took an example to see the contrast between the US and Bangladesh, referring to the amount of meat consumed, car ownership, flights taken. Although the environmental issue impacts the people globally, for example, flood and rising seafloor.

I agree with what you said. The fact that the green new deal treats climate crisis as threat to national security would help it become more accepted for the public. The great thing about the resolution is that it shows how climate change can worsen other social problems such as oppression, wage gaps, and economical collapse. The article's use of responsibility particularly struck a chord with me. We as Americans like to believe in equality and freedom for all; the fact that America produces more carbon emissions than many developing countries creates a unfair situation in which other people suffer the brunt of the consequences of our solutions. The resolution defines the dangers both to the world and American economy if we continue down this path. Logically, we must do something to curb climate change or devastating effects will appear in a mere decades. Unfortunately most of US political decisions are not logical.


<br><hr>
Upon reading "The Green New Deal," I also got a thorough understanding of the legislation and the government's relationship with the climate crisis. The cause of the climate crisis, as recognized in the beginning of the Green New Deal is human caused. Therefore, socioeconomic structures are largely responsible for the climate crisis, as most of us globally are all part of a larger political structure. We see this in not only the United States, but also their relationship with other nations. The United States and the capitalist function exploits poorer nations. We see this as the professor kept on mentioning Bangladesh. Bangladesh is socioeonomically stratified in comparison to developed nations, has a relatively small carbon footprint, and yet is largely impacted by the climate crisis and global relations with developed nations. Bangladesh is facing most of the consequences of the climate crisis because of its economic positionality meanwhile the US has a much larger carbon footprint and not facing near the amount of consequences Blangladesh is.
           <br><br>
The Green New Deal helps make more clear the relationship between political relations and the climate crisis. The resolution definitely validates the climate crisis and its consequences, such as global temperature rise, CO2 emmissions, greenhouse gases etc, but it also recognizes the social and economic consequences and threats that the climate crisis imposes. The Green New Deal ties the direct enablers of the climate crisis in the US, which is the US itself to the climate crisis, therefore making more clear who is contributing to the climate crisis. By doing so, accountability and action is able to be made, which is what the resolution itself proposes. It is no coincidence that the climate crisis, which has eponentially increased within a lifetime, has greatly worsened within the period of the intensificaiton of a market economy and capitalism.
           <br><br>
One thing I found interesting is that the resolution lists that the climate crisis may be a threat to national security. We see as Ken mentioned, how proximal the relationship between social, environmental, and climate justice really is more related than many actually think. Therefore, among the solutions that the Green New Deal proposes, many of the solutions may be referred to what Ken mentioned as “degrowth.” The Green New Deal focuses on things such as reparations, investing in sustainable infrastructure, providing resources to local communities, focusing on local and regional economies, protecting resources, ensuring a fair commercial environment, and so on. Therefore, it would not be wrong to see environmental and climate justice as related to social justice as well.

The reading titled “The Green New Deal” provides us with a summary of changes in our current climate culture; it also stated a number of proposed changes. The legislation in question went beyond simply addressing issues on the surface. It stated that because the United States is such a large contributor to the global emissions, it need to take on a leading role in these steps fighting against climate changes. In addition to dealing with internal issues, the United States have a responsibility to solve other countries’ problems such as those from Bangladesh. The Green New Deal could be an ideal solution to the number of climate problems facing us today.

I agree completely that because the U.S is the main contributor to the large amounts of CO2 emissions, it is this country’s duty to start solving this problem, and yet it angers me greatly to know that other countries who aren’t even ⅕ responsible for the emissions are making greater strides in attempting to switch to new green energies. The Green New Deal is a document of hope but also frustration because this very document has basically outlined what this country has to do to at least start reversing or lessening everything that’s already been done to this planet. I have hope knowing that the Green New Deal could be giving solutions that are very much possible to accomplish. But. the truly depressing part of this reading? The sad part of all of this is that the government, the very same people who are allowing our planet to continue deteriorate at a faster and faster pace every year, know about this Green Deal and see what can be done, but they simply do not care. That is the hardest pill to swallow. The public can only do so much, but it is the responsibility of the corporations who created this problem to start fixing their mess.

After reading "The Green New Deal", I believe I have a much better understanding of what it actually is along with what it stands for. The Green New Deal sounds like an amazing plan not only to help fight climate change but to create equality and help minorities. To makes sure that everyone has the basic necessities in order to live. I would like to think that this plan may be the solution to our problems however I fear that this plan will be executed. It is discouraging when our own president does not believe in climate change, or even laughs about it, when you see how politics play a major role in these climate laws not being passed because they would lose a large amount of money. In Kens video, he compares the US to Bangladesh, and the statistics are incredibly shocking. I can’t imagine how much more greenhouse gasses the US omits in comparison to Bangladesh because the numbers are so big, where they barely eat meat and very few use cars/air travels. It is very noticeable who needs to step up and fight against for what we have done.

I agree that this week's reading,  “The Green New Deal" was quite enlightening.  Ken's point of how social, environmental, and climate justice are intersectionally linked made much sense in regards to the negative impacts placed on our planet and its inhabitants.  The Green New Deal provides us with effective solutions to solve the climate crisis.  For the United States to be one of the main contributors in releasing greenhouse gas emissions, it is up to us to take responsibility and help the poorer countries from the problems we have left them in.  Many people might be unsure about how they can participate to make a difference in solving the climate crisis.  The Green New Deal serves as an effective tool to make lifestyle changes that will gear us on the right track.

After reading "Green New Deal", the problem has become very clear for the United States. The article states, "...because the United States has historically been responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions, having emitted 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions through 2014, and has a high technological capacity, the United States must take a leading role in reducing emissions through economic transformation" and then continues on to stage out the economic hardships that we are currently facing that are preventing us from taking great economic action. I think that this point explains exactly why we are not acting. The United States is centered around the money period. The economy is the number one importance in our world regardless of what its effects are on anything else. Even though we are the leaders in contributing to climate change, changing that fact would mean a tough change in our economic status which I don't think Americans are prepared for unfortunately. 
           <br><br>

 I think the article however does a really good job at connecting all of the potential issues of both climate change and the other challenges to the world and leading them all back to one another proving that one cannot be solved without the other. We cannot have a flourishing economy when climate change continues to rise and we can not have a flourishing world when the economy stays in the lead for importance. All of these aspects must be taken on in tandem in order to make them work together for our world. I do not think it is reasonable to assume that we will sacrifice our economy and stop everything we have worked too hard to build up in order to stop an idea of climate change in which many people don't even support. With this in mind, it is important to come to a crossroad and present both sides with a solution that will benefit everyone and not simply cut out the biggest industry in society or our world's health.

I appreciate Ken’s consideration for other developing countries that the US shares one planet with, as he said “US’s challenge is to reel in our environmentally disastrous lifestyle……Alternatively, for the developing world, the challenge is for everybody to live rich and meaningful lives while not raising greenhouse gas emissions to unacceptable levels in the process.” Understanding that the developing world has to progress is important. For example, with the connections Al Gore made, India is able to skip their “coal phase” and straight to solar power. 
           <br><br>

As for the question of should America be responsible for Bangladesh’s natural disasters, we all know that the US “should take a quarter of the responsibility”, and my country too should take a large portion of the blame. But I’d like to not think that way. If we were to blame for Bangladesh’s flood, then wildfires in California and the flooding in Miami could also be blamed, partially, on my home country China.
           <br><br>

I’d like to think of this as a problem for humankind. In Joaquin Phenix’s short acceptance speech of winning the award of Best Actor in a Leading Role, he did not thank his colleagues and families like most actors, instead, he shares the same concern as we do, addressed climate crisis as one of the “distressing issues we are facing collectively.” Then he kept on talking about how grateful he is for given second chances, and how he thinks that though love and compassion human beings could prevail. I think there’s no better way of articulating his ideas than to quote the man himself “……I think that’s when we’re at our best: when we support each other. Not when we cancel each other out for our past mistakes, but when we help each other to grow. When we educate each other; when we guide each other to redemption.”, “But human beings at our best are so creative and inventive, and we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and the environment.”
           <br><br>

I could not get more excited when an award-winning actor uses his own voice to raise attention to the injustice and crises of this world.

Yes, such sweeping changes will likely be very expensive to implement, but the end result will save much more in terms of stopping the damage that climate change will continue to create if left unchecked. Just as the town of Paradise believed it was too expensive and not worth it to widen their roads and consequently lost their entire town in the fire, the United States government needs to realize that if we don’t act now to prevent further damage, the losses accrued will be irreparable. Not only will implementing these changes benefit the entire planet as a whole, it will create jobs in the process, as it will take a lot of work to make such sweeping modifications to the way our society runs.
           <br><br>


I think it’s really important that the Green New Deal puts such a focus on not disadvantaging minorities/communities at risk while following through with this plan, as Ken points out. The United States has been such a heavy contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, and the effects will mostly be felt by those who did the least to cause the damage. The idea that the rich can afford to cushion themselves (at least for a time) while the poor and disadvantaged take the brunt of the damage is absolutely appalling. In time, however, even those at the top will be forced to confront the damage done if sweeping changes are not made, because there is no way to hide from the climate.

The Green New Deal almost seems like a culmination of everything that Ken has been telling us to do. From reforming how we move around to agriculture improvements I almost thought I was reading one of Ken's lectures. The Green New Deal attacks almost every big problem. It says we must use renewable energy sources, mass transit and high speed rail (which I think would be really fun to ride on), and even improve farming practices. One thing I didn't see straight out attacked is the meat industry. It implies it, as it speaks of reforestation and similar processes, but I cannot help to feel this would not be enough. It is definitely a step in the right direction, but it seems like the Paris Accords to me. Theoretically good, but easy not to follow. Just like Trump taking us out of the Paris Accords, what is going to stop a new president or congress from making the Green New Deal just a blip in history. For, me I would need to see some of these policies in action before I can believe this will actually work.

Before this week I had only heard of the Green New Deal but never knew what the document consisted of.  All I knew was that it supported a Carbon-free society so I was on board.  However, the side I didn't and find more interesting is where the document states with brutal honesty that the Green New Deal is going to negatively affect the lower middle class and poor people.  This makes me want to support the article even more as it is being truthful that it isn't an easy fix, all black, and white, but with the help of American people, we can save the planet.  On the other hand, while honesty made me more of a fan it definitely has turned those in the classes affected away from this movement.  I have seen on the news that even some Democrats are not supporting the Green New Deal since it's so ambitious and will cause a huge reform in the United States.  The choice that the Green New Deal offers us do we have our people suffer for a while, but have a chance a secure future or live comfortably now, but disrupts millions of lives down the road.

The Green New Deal states that it aims to make us international leaders on climate action. I appreciate this goal, however we have quite a ways to go to achieve it, and achieve it thoroughly, not just for the clout. The US tends to show off the sustainable practices we do, and preach these to other countries. It is of course very beneficial and even necessary to share technologies and ideas globally to reach sustainability goals, because climate change is a global issue. However the US is one of the, if not the leader in greenhouse gas emissions. United Statesians live consumptive lifestyles, it is tied into the foundation of our country, in capitalism and in the American Dream. We like to promote the sustainable practices we do, however our overall initiative is extremely lacking. I would love to see the US become a leader on the global scale, however it is hard for me to imagine because many of United Statesians core values as a nation are rooted in consumption and wealth.
           <br><br>
All that being said, I think the Green New Deal is a great initiative to start the process, and to go in the right direction. Seeing as the GND is a policy package idea, I am very excited to see how the ideas  (like public transit, healthy food for all, zero emissions, cleanup of hazardous and abandoned sites and environmental justice) are implemented in policy.

Going into this week's reading, I hadn't really known much about the Green New Deal besides the term being name-dropped every now and then. Now, having had the chance to finally read what it's about, I'm more than happy with what I learned. It's so exciting to see climate change in the political world and how politics is helping mitigate the consequences of climate change. However, I'm skeptical as to how all of this can be made happen and how we go about undertaking such a feat and process. It sounds so ideal, but the most difficult part will actually be executing it. Nonetheless, it's interesting to see how climate change can affect so much of the economy. It seems like climate change is something that I continue to learn more and more about every time. It's so extensive.
           <br><br>

What's also interesting yet disheartening is the fact that our first-world nation is so privileged and selfish in how we act, while countries like Bangladesh are getting thrown under the bus for something that is honestly hardly their fault at all. For being a country that is so progressive, open-minded, and filled with joy and freedom, one can only begin to think if all of this is achieved through the expense of others.

Interesting comment Josh! I too really enjoyed reading about the Green New Deal, since I knew very little about it prior. I am hopeful that the new legislation will actually make a difference because changes like these have a much larger impact than individual people changing a few things about their daily life. What struck out to me most was how costly it is to put out a fire and how much C02 emissions will be a result of gathering all the necessary parts in order to successfully distinguish wildfires. I think the US needs to lead by example and can't expect for Bangladesh to change if we don't first.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading "The Green New Deal" as an assignment for this week because it encompassed the political and social aspects of the climate crisis. I had always heard of "The Green New Deal" but never further looked into it and I am glad I was able to become a lot more educated about it after this reading. What intrigued me about this reading was that it not only covered the environmental impacts that the climate crisis is having, but the economic and social injustices that come along with it. This is important to bring up when presenting a bill because it gives a perspective from all aspects dealing with the climate crisis. I liked how the bill presented the climate crisis in a light that encourage the United States to take immediate action for what we have caused. It does not address or blame other countries for the negative impacts of our climate, but instead focuses on resolutions that must occur before the climate crisis destroys our planet. 
           <br><br>

I also liked how the bill shed light on the social inequality that is ingrained in the climate crisis. Low-income communities will be the first to suffer as they will not have access to clean water or air. This automatically reminded me of the Flint Water Crisis and how low-income communities are looked passed upon when they need the most support. With the way we are emitting CO2 into the atmosphere, these low-income communities will not have support for the disasters that are to come and AOC addresses this in "The Green New Deal".

I too had never actually read the Green New deal, but have only heard of it in climate discussions until now. After reading it, I think that it could be, if not already, one of the most important pieces of legislation that need to be passed in the history of this nation. Not only does it address the causes of this climate change and what we can do to fix them, but it aims to fix the social, economic, and cultural effects that we face as a result of climate change. I think that as a policymaker, this piece of legislation should be a no-brainier to support, since it doesn't favor any one particular group of people, but rather the human race as a whole. It was kind of shocking the amount of detail that the bill was able to outline while still being relatively easy in its ability to be understood. Things like power consumption, public infrastructure, and environmental destruction are addressed in terms of their projected future, and are called on to be sources of change for the US as a nation. In conjunction with these ideas, the green new deal outlines the social and economic disparities between certain groups, and argues that this is all a result of the climate crisis' inadvertent effects on us. Additionally, it calls for basic rights like clean water/air and safe housing to be available to all who live in this great nation, not for just those who are economically stable. 
           <br><br>
In terms of helping other nations, I think the most we can do as a nation is to be a leading figure in fight against climate change. Since the US has been a major contributor of greenhouse gasses in terms of sheer output, its only our duty to clean up the mess that has been made. Through these emissions the US has become a world superpower, leading even the greatest nations in times of crisis. As a result,  the US needs to step up and once again take action for this global problem, paving the way for developing countries to not make the same mistakes that the US has made.

After reading “The Green New Deal”, I was able to understand that there IS a plan that legislation has in order to mitigate the climate crisis as well as improving our economy overall (as it is a vital aspect of making changes). I found it to be pretty significant that there’s an in depth, written document that discusses ways to do both of these things.  The Green New Deal included information on the United State’s legislation and the efforts towards improving air conditions, protecting coral reefs, reducing greenhouse emissions, and saving wildlife. It also brings attention to how much big corporations extract fossil fuels from the ground and its weighing effects on the entire economy. As citizens of the richest country in the world, it’s truly important to take these plans seriously, so that we can move forward with it and make it a reality. If enough U.S. citizens become more aware of the information that the Green New Deal contains, we can make sure that the fine print turns into actions.

I appreciate the variety in the readings that we are assigned. It was exciting to see an official looking document this week as we have talked a lot in class about wanting to see real political change. I definitely agree with the above comment regarding this document's importance. I think that this document perfectly lies out the main details and great goals to shoot for. “Recognizing that human activity is the dominant cause of observed climate change in the past century”. This stuck with me because there are people out there (mostly the older generation) who really don’t believe anything is wrong with our climate nor did they do “something wrong” to contribute to it. It’s literally in this official document which should be great evidence of its validity. What worries me most is the consequences of climate change if we do not act. There really will be climate wars and mass migration from areas that are hurt the worst (who contributed the least) and I know that will not be met with kindness. It is going to be an era of mass injustice and heartbreak for all. Additionally it is so incredibly sad that we could lose 99 percent of coral reefs. One of my greatest passions is scuba diving and I love exploring that underwater world. If the coral leaves, fish and many sea creatures will lose their homes and the ocean system as we know it will be forever changed. I definitely want to be doing the most to prevent that catastrophe from occurring. I was happy to be stopped outside the UCen the other day by a CalPirg representative who explained to me how to donate ($10 a quarter) that would go towards great causes (for our oceans). Hopefully students and adults alike can be proactive about our current situation to pave a better future for the next generations.

Hi Vanessa,
           <br><br>

I think that it is extremely sad how we as a nation are more focused on Republicans vs. Democrats as opposed to collectively coming together to solve the existing climate crisis. There is such a large emphasis on who's right and who's wrong, we often forget that there are people out there who are voiceless. We are most focused on our ego and stomping out "the other" instead of focusing on the real problem-- that there might not be an Earth if we continue to live at this rate.

I have heard of the Green New Deal before but I had never actually read on about it until now. Before reading it I knew that it involved actions that address climate change. Now that I have read it, I see how it is a plan for the future. They have plans for renewable energy, making changes to farming and mass transportation. They also want people to have access to healthy foods.They bring up the vulnerable people in the United States and the need to protect them and have their voices heard. They want people to have an equal opportunity in the US and have access to water, healthcare, education, access to nature, etc. 
           <br><br>
One thing I really liked that was outlined in the Green New Deal was that we respect the land of the indigenous people because it's something that the U.S has a history of not doing. For example, in Hawaii they want to build a telescope for science on sacred land and the indigenous people of Hawaii have been fighting to keep their land protected. Chancellor Yang is actually involved in the project, and they were even arresting people who were protesting.  As Ken mentioned, this Deal only mentions Americans and does not have a plan for others around the world. I think that it is important that the US helps other countries around the world also adopt a plan that will move them into sustainable renewable energy since we are one of the country's most responsible for the CO2 emissions going into the Earth. Plus, we owe it to the world since the US profits off of minorities when they take their companies to other countries for cheap labor.

While this video didn't talk about the GND specifically, I still think it is an important video to include in talking about the GND since both talk about social/environmental/climate justice. The GND focuses on these issues of injustice domestically, via strong unions, fair wages, access to clean environment and living space (air, water, etc.), access to affordable public transportation, and others. The GND didn't specifically talk about justice internationally, it nonetheless plays an essential role in mitigating the climate crisis and fulfilling the moral obligation the US owes to the rest of the world after all the pain we have inflicted (and if we don't change, will continue to inflict) on the rest of the world. The US has a huge responsibility to engage in environmentally-friendly foreign policy. I agree with a Green Marshall Plan. This is not only good for the environment and works toward fulfilling the US's moral obligation I feel that we definitely owe to the rest of the world, especially developing countries, but it also would benefit the US dramatically. Developing countries often don't have the resources to invest in the environmentally friendly development necessary to prevent the worst consequences of climate change. It is up to the US to invest in other countries and help them find their eco-friendly footing. This would not only help the environment, which benefits us all, but would also greatly improve the world economy. It would also allow the US to keep its favorite position of world super power (so long as you define super power as the country that can impact the most positive change around the world, like I do).

When I first saw our reading assignment this week, I didn't even know what the "Green New Deal" was. While I was reading it, I was confused as to why there was no action being stated. It just summarized and stated what will happen if we continue to emit CO2 emissions or continue to heat up our planet. After I finished reading it, I understood what I read but I didn't understand why it was written if it wasn't going to propose a certain plan of action. I appreciate how it raised awareness about climate change and what we should do to stop it. After watching Ken's lecture on "Social justice, environmental justice, climate justice, and the injustice of it all," I felt ashamed for even being in the U.S. We cause so much damage and we are so selfish to ask others to reduce their carbon footprint when we are the ones who have the biggest one of all. This whole system is a hypocrite. We sell reusable straws to consumers because of the current climate culture yet the factories that make the straws emit CO2 itself. We say to buy less, yet every screen is constantly advertising something. We promote donating clothes, but half the clothes we donate don't even make it to goodwills and end up in a landfill. This whole system is a joke and that's the true injustice of it all. The saddest thing of all is that the people who didn't even contribute to climate change are the ones who will suffer the most.

I couldn’t agree more. The US population tends to point the finger at other countries for the way they run things and contribute to degrading the environment. But our situation is much worse. The US comes in second in biggest emitter of CO2, contributing 15% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. It’s unbelievable, there’s 195 countries. Americans over consume ridiculously and frontier and vulnerable communities pay the price for it the most. The Green New Deal mentions a lot of things that need to be addressed in the way that the US economy runs itself addressing social, environmental and economic injustices in the process. All of the things it offers sounds amazing. I do agree, however, that there is no plan to it, no steps to how we will accomplish everything it lists. On the optimistic side, I do realize that this Green New Deal was a simple script of a developing bill that can then later be proposed

Previous to this reading, I had no real idea about what the Green New Deal actually entailed. Like most Americans, I figured that the bill probably just focused on cutting back emissions and helping the environment whatever that might be. However after reading the bill, I now realize that their is a deeper logic behind the Green New Deal focusing on building a new economy no longer centered around fossil fuels and this time including poc and other minorities in the new economic success. For as long as I can remember from my various history classes, I am constantly reminded that WW2 was a pivotal moment into shaping the modern American economy and consumer society we see today. Consequently, I love the idea of using the climate crisis as another pivotal moment in history to restructure our society in order to create numerous economic and social benefits. In fact the idea of the Green New Deal actually makes me hopeful for the future amidst a problem like the climate crisis that can be so torrential. I think part of the reason I love the idea of the GND so much is that AOC specifically addresses how minority groups were often times exempt from the economic success and wealth garnished from the fossil fuel economy. As a politician, she is addressing both social justice issues and environmental justice all in one general plan in my opinion. Although the plan is not inherently specific, I think it's a great outline to start infrastructural change in this country while not coming off as too radical or impossible to achieve.

After watching Ken’s video I can clearly understand how he feels about the ideas presented in the reading, “The Green New Deal”, because he urges the viewers to see how the data in the meat industry and the air travel industry is a detriment to the global climate crisis. He references how the average American consumes 6600% more meat than the average person in Bangladesh and that the average American travels in the air hundred times more than those other third world countries. These statistics are presented to show that our cultural practices as Americans need to change, and that not legislation alone will solve the issue. Because it is commonly understood that politicians in America are biased and heavily influenced by funded third parties, it is extremely difficult to establish and uphold practices that, realistically, have a negative effect on our economy and harm the way of capitalism. In addition, modern American has become so corporate heavy, much of the political control comes from those with money, typically corporations, buying their way out of regulations and prosecution. Ken also mentions that there are such laws we can change to influence people to change their ways, but I believe that on a national or global scale, there is little we can do to limit wealth-dominant control.

This is an astute observation that I agree with wholeheartedly. Americans lack a sense of community especially in an economic sense. People are quick to buy the things that they personally desire without much thought to the impact a purchase or production of a product has environmentally. This is an individualistic approach to being a consumer, one that has enabled a huge and detrimental environmental impact. Corporations care more about their resources than the effect that their consumption or distribution of resources has on our planet. The need for control over the market sways large businesses to overlook key factors in keeping our world healthy and clean. It is a sad truth that we bow to politics and economics in this kind of market. It would take a drastic change in wealth distribution to have an impact on legislation because of lobbyists and corporations ability to pay for these people to fight to protect their wealth and profit. This isn’t something to expect but rather to fight for. It will take time and an increase in environmental education to push our government to look towards our future rather than their greed of the present.

Someone in my high school biology class told me that the reason why he was a Republican was that Democrats think with their heart and pathos and Republicans think with logic and realistic solutions. He clearly did not read or even think about AOC’s Green New Deal. Reading the New Deal was very easy and the list of causes from the beginning was not new information; it was either common knowledge or something that Ken taught. There are so many alternatives and different opportunities to support the economy if we stop fossil fuels completely. Yet, Republicans are apprehensive about going on with the New Deal because they feel they would lose money and authority. We need a new wave of politicians who are aware of the climate crisis like AOC. This is why I am excited to be able to vote this year- to elect officials who are passionate about the climate crisis and introducing policies regional or national that can have long-lasting effects to climate change. For the boomers or Republicans who are worried about immigrants “taking over” America or good health care with a retirement plan, they should support the New Green Deal. When the world does reach two degrees celsius and more, first world countries, especially America, will experience mass migration as seen in the Deal. Ken mentioned Bangladesh, a third world country that has experienced turmoil due to America’s corporate and industrial greed. Once we reach two degrees celsius, citizens in third world countries like Bangladesh will migrate to America because it would be easier living. AOC also proposed that the Green New Deal would provide everyone with quality health care, housing, and economic security. That checks off most of the boxes that boomers or Republicans worry about anyways. If the Deal is still seen as “too radical” even with the science supporting it, then we should prepare for the worst come 2030 or 2050.

While reading "The Green New Deal," I was overjoyed to see that the government wants to take a stance on climate change. The people in power are aware of the dangers of climate change in our country, as well as the rest of the world. One aspect that I thought was particularly interesting was Section 4G, where they state that this deal will ensure the creation of "high-quality union jobs that pay prevailing wages." I think most Americans will appreciate this, since a common fear of climate change reform is the loss of jobs in the oil industry. I still cannot believe that there are politicians against The Green New Deal, even though it is helping our citizens and our environment. There is not a single negative aspect of this deal. 

           <br><br>

Ken's video was thought provoking because as people of the developed world, we often forget about our impacts on the underdeveloped countries. I was surprised to see that there is a 21000% increase in ownership of cars between America and Bangladesh. I come from a middle-class family that lives in the suburbs of Los Angeles. As a family of four, we have four vehicles, one for each member. Now that I look at these statistics, there is absolutely no reason for all four of us to individually own a car. It is not necessary, as conveyed by Ken's videos on transportation. Our greed and selfishness has caused a surplus of emissions, which inevitably causes third-world countries, such as Bangladesh, to suffer. Because 25% of the emissions are put out by our country, I believe it is our responsibility to help fix burden that we have caused. We must use our wealth to help ourselves and under-developed areas of the world so that we can all make a difference in the climate crisis. After all, when doomsday arrives, we are all going to suffer, not just the underdeveloped countries.

I wholly agree that the Green New Deal is good all-around, and the broad resolutions it makes are very uncontroversial. It does show that Congress is indeed aware of climate change, but it also shows the willful ignorance and deception by many members on both sides of the aisle when they attack the Green New Deal. It is two parts: "Green" and "New Deal", where, as the Vox video points out beautifully, they try to take on the opposing ideals of cutting climate change fueling jobs and trying to get new, quality jobs for Americans. AOC I believe perfectly encapsulates what "democratic socialism" means when she speaks of a "partnership with frontline and vulnerable communities, labor unions, worker cooperatives, civil society groups, academia, and businesses". This is not merely an inefficient, bloated government taking care of everything as many conservatives would have you believe. Perhaps even a model of degrowth (or some level of stagnation) could be incorporated into this as Ken mentions, but this would require a massive cultural change where these ideas could ever be accepted. I know that I still associate stagnation as being a necessarily bad thing, even if infinite growth logically isn't possible. 

           <br><br>

But this is where the "New Deal" part really comes in: wages have largely stagnated, if not declined when considering the purchasing power of these wages, while worker productivity has gone up considerably (https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text#idc2ece21d3b6c47e189aa1b0025a97033). While the desire to feel rich and overabundant is shared among Americans as a cultural value, the reality is that this greed has benefitted a select group of individuals, a kind of capitalistic oligarchy (avoiding the Marxist language even if very applicable). While fixing what we've done wrong in other nations through direct funds may be difficult to pass, we can still try to pass legislation or create agencies that help enforce fair trade, including from a climate justice perspective. If the work becomes undesirable in other nations by that point, so be it, since that can potentially lead to decent paying jobs in the US.


<br><hr>
I agree with you, when I began reading the Green New Deal it finally felt like elected officials were hearing my voice, and the voice of so many in our generation. I appreciate that the Green New Deal seeks to make life in the US better in general, not just by improving the environment, but by helping to improve the basic standards of living for Americans across the board. Sections that denoted access to adequate health care, economic development, and job growth were important to me, because I think it reflects to people that the Green New Deal isn’t just part of some “agenda for renewable energy”, it’s ultimate goal is to better the lives of people, and in turn improve the environment. 
           <br><br>
Additionally, Ken’s question about the US’s role in aid was very provocative. I think that the United States should definitely aid countries like Bangladesh, because they will be severely affected by climate change. Unfortunately, the United States was the primary perpetrator of this problem and will have to take little responsibility for it. I think that if the impacts of climate change were more shocking in the United States, climate change denial would not be a problem.

I agree with what Ken said in the video, in the US, we have a way developed and better life than people living in developing countries like Bangladesh. However, people in those poor, less developed areas are suffering from the consequences of the climate crisis that we should take a huge portion of responsibility. Just like what was said in the reading, the US is responsible for 20 percent of the greenhouse emission. When I saw this data, I was shocked and felt bad for those countries. We, as a well-developed country, are able to be protected from the environmental crisis, but people from countries like Bangladesh are pretty much not able to do this just because  they don’t have the technology and developments that we have. 
           <br><br>
For those solutions listed in the article, I don’t think we can make every single of them happen, but I’m still happy to see the government start to work on those environmental problems instead of just ignoring them.

This week's reading was very interesting because it encouraged me to re-approach an issue that I already had a stance on with a new found knowledge. 

           <br><br>

When I had first heard about the Green New Deal, I had no idea about the extent of climate change and its surrounding consequences. I was 'typical' in the sense that I thought that climate change was immensely blown out of proportion and that the lowering of CO2 output could be gradually decreased over time as we converted over to renewables. When thats' your idea of climate change, propositions like the Green New Deal seem extreme and alarmist. To me, this shows the that the 'everything isn't that bad' propaganda the oil companies peddled to the American people is has worked. By putting in a sense of doubt, drastic solutions appear extreme and create strong opposition.

           <br><br>

My thoughts now on the Green New deal have changed from thinking it was crazy to thinking if real propositions are put forth to make it a reality it may a way towards a solution. From an economic point of view, it just boils down to creating more debt in the hopes that a new middle class's incomes will help repay it.

Interesting what you are saying about the debt aspect. Indeed, it is unreasonable to think the GND (though likely necessary) will happen without some sort of deficit increase. Opponents of the GND will attack the GND precisely with this fact. They may say "oh well how are we goona pay for this?" and argue that the GND is fiscally irresponsible and ultimately damaging to the economy. 
           <br><br>

This is obviously a flawed perspective to have, since the current administration is far from being fiscally responsible, and as you say debt isn't an ultimate calamity as investments create more income which leads to a multiplier effect ultimately allowing a repaying of debt. Unless you hardcore believe in Ricardian Equivalence that is. 
           <br><br>

So yeah when an admin that pays billions for useless walls cries about boohoo how we goona pay from this GND things well it seems a little ridiculous and frankly incoherent.

This week’s reading explores yet another side of the political aspect of the climate crisis, which is a critical factor to the entire movement. Many times have we already emphasized before the power of our politics in this situation, and this set of resolutions overviews a huge array of statistical warnings to face if we are not to act upon anything governmentally through policies. I particularly had to do a double take, recounting the number of zeros, reading that there is a risk of damage of $1 trillion of public infrastructure and coastal real estate in the United States. It seems rightfully so that since the United States put out such a large quantity of greenhouse gas in comparison to others, that they take a huge role in leading the reduction rate in return. One of the things I was able to figure out while reading through this resolution, was that the relation between climate crisis concerns for a better, healthier planet, is very deeply involved with a better, healthier community both physically, mentally, economically, and much more. This phrase of “net-zero” is popularly used these days when talking about climate goals, and as of right now, from what I have seen, seems to be a very unlikely goal. I think it is something we definitely should work towards, however, will be incredibly difficult in achieving and maintaining. To explain, I remember walking around UCSB seeing “net-zero” being promoted for waste for the purpose of reaching zero-waste. The year on the promotion simply changed when the goal was ultimately not met, and I fear that this is just what will keep happening every time we set a goal, don’t meet it, and push the date another 5 years, which seems foolish. More effort definitely could be made to prevent this or at least show more diligence to meet such high standard goals. One of the suggestions made that I liked was to ensure that any infrastructure bill considered by Congress to address climate change, which I think is a necessary step. I remember learning about something related to this in my business administration writing course last summer, that there are requirements set for all businesses related to environmental measures. In every business proposal, we were taught that it is key to include how we as a business plan to reduce our environmental impact. I really liked this, as it holds all businesses accountable to acknowledging their harms and how they plan to combat them, which is like putting many different heads together to think up solutions to how to face our future all the while still developing our economy and future development.

As I began reading the proposed Green New Deal, I simply felt more helpless. Yes it acknowledges climate change and stresses the importance of mitigating our current emissions but the proposal fails to address a concrete manner of going about this. Additionally, the vagueness of the report simultaneously neglects to properly address the issue while also leaving room for interpretation. Reading this also reminded me of all the other reports released similar to this one that have been met with no action and made e question how this one is any different. 
           <br><br>


        I also found it ironic how the deal encourages the Unites States to take a ‘leading role’ in reducing emissions despite the fact that the Unites States has accounted for the majority of emissions in the atmosphere. Currently, countless other countries have had far more success in addressing the climate crisis issue within their own country and the only way I see the United States accomplishing this is if the climate crisis is no longer politicized by parties in a polarizing way. I do fully believe that if the United States were to make dramatic changes in order to cut emissions and instill mitigation tactics, that other countries would then follow, however that is just not the reality of the current situation. Moreover, how can the United States be in any position to call for developing countries to change their ways when we ourselves cannot even accomplish this domestically. One aspect of the deal that was rightfully addressed was the fate of the workers who would be at risk of suffering form this transition into a greener economy. Many people use this argument to combat any forces trying to instill a transition, so i found it reassuring that the deal in the very least assured these people a level of security. That being said, I fully support any efforts being made to try to address the issue however this issue is not being met with the proper urgency it calls for.

I was impressed when I saw that the meat consumption difference, the air traveling difference, and the car ownership between Bangladesh and the United States are so big.  I mean, 4 pounds of meat per year sound horrible and unbelievable to me. Moreover, as we can even experience serious traffic jams frequently, it is quite hard to imagine a city with few cars but motorcycles or scooters running on the road if only four people in a thousand own a car.  As Ken also mentioned social, environmental, and climate justice, I think America really should do something to ensure future interest by helping Bangladesh and the rest of the world.

Great comment Yan. After watching this video, I believe I share the same thoughts with you. Just like what you said, the gap between developed countries and the developing countries can be huge. Just like what the professor mentions in the video, people in the U.S. eat 66 per hundred percent more meet than those people who live in Bangladesh. I have to admit that I was shocked after hearing this. That’s a huge difference that I’ve never imagined. I think that’s why the professor introduces the concept of social justices and other kind of justices in the video, that is, to have different solution regards to this problem based on different countries’ conditions.

After reading "The Green New Deal," I found that I agree with most of those points in this political article. I heard something that I have never heard before. It shows in this reading material that the United States is in the leading role on combating environmental issues. I think it's pretty obvious that people can feel global warming, and the poor people will suffer more than the rich people. In this reading article, the United States supervises and provides good ideas for other countries in this world to solve these global environmental issues. And it's easy for us to see that "The Green New Deal" is the only way out for us. The environmental problem, like I said, seems nothing to us now, but as the time goes, it will cause serious problems for our next generations.

I like this comment because it was something that stunned me as well but kind of makes sense at the same time. Although the U.S. is taking a leading role in combating environmental issues, we kind of have to. Throughout Ken’s lectures there is a common theme of how the U.S. mainly but most of the developed world lives in such excess and wastefulness. For us not to be in a leading role would embarrass me as an American. It is our duty at this point, because we are also one of the leaders in producing the most waste and carbon emissions, to also be on a mission to change our ways and become a more environmentally friendly country.

I enjoyed this week's reading of the Green New Deal because we are finally seeing political action taking place. We are seeing new ideas to combat the very physical problem of climate change. I was especially pleased to see how the legislature acknowledges that the US was a key contributor to this problem thus we should be the main solution. I think it was ingenious for Ken to compare Bangladesh with the United States. Not only is it a country with a huge population but it is a country rapant with poverty, starvation and environmental injustice. As Americans we cannot wrap our heads around the fact that people willingly take jobs in horrible working conditions but I think Ken explains it really well, “If one in four of your friends was starving it’d be quite an incentive to take any job on offer.” We must realize that just because we don’t directly see the effects of climate change right outside our door it doesn't mean it's not happening. It takes the form of poor infrastructures, low rates of education, high rates of births, rise in poverty and a top 1% as well as deep seeded dissatisfaction with the government. Social justice, environmental justice and climate justice all go hand in hand. From the factory workers who work in terrible conditions to the pollution those factories emit, all matters must be reformed. Bangladesh is a country that will suffer terribly if climate change continues, 10,000 sq miles or 18% of all land in Bangladesh is flooded due to sea level rise. 5,000 people are killed as well as 7 million homes are destroyed. Wealthy countries all over the world use Bangladesh as their testing or dumping ground while they get richer the rest of the country suffers more and more. We as Americans live in luxury compared to these people whenever there is a natural disaster there will almost always be governmental aid or at least media coverage about the event while countries like Bangladesh don’t even have the adequate organizations or equipment to deal with a natural disaster. It is a terrible irony that Bangladesh is an earthquake hotspot, prone to droughts, storm surges, erosion and is susceptible to cyclones and tsunamis. Americans have a great responsibility to aid countries when they suffer from these disasters because we are the root of the climate crisis as we know it.

In the reading “The Green New Deal”, it perfectly elaborates in detail about how the Green New Deal actually works to resolve the problem of the climate crisis happening in the U.S. right now. It not only demonstrates how we should act environmentally, but also socially, culturally, and economically, which is more comprehensive than the readings assigned before. It first lays out several serious problems that we all are confronting and then goes deeper into how these problems could potentially exacerbate the situation. Moreover, this is quite promising since many systematic and feasible resolutions are established to be implemented on a national level and undeniably, the U.S. is now one of the most powerful and influential nations in the world, so we could expect that the Green New Deal will have such a great influence on this one. I believe that putting this package of legislation into real practices, the situation would be much better.

           <br><br>

In the video, Ken mainly talks about how people from different countries are facing different kinds of problems. He brings up the contrast, in the aspect of meat consumption, flights taken by citizens, and the number of cars owned, between the U.S. and Bangladesh, explaining that different situations should be treated with proper mindsets and methods. Based on my knowledge, the United States is currently on the TOP 3 of the ranking of greenhouse-gas emissions per capita, in which we all should definitely pay attention to that. Fortunately, with powerful policies like the Green New Deal, I think the climate crisis would soon be mitigated.

Green New Deal sounds great. It is good at being unspecific enough that it entices readers and make them want better conditions. If it were long specific policies where the pros and cons could be argued and dissected, I don’t think people would want to read. Like AOC says, “we can be whatever we have the courage to see”. The Green New Deal instills an image of a better future and makes them want change. Better than the New Deal, which excluded marginalized groups from benefits, Green New Deal aims to help all while reducing inequality and mitigating the climate crisis. It sounds great but has no specifics. It is not a bill or a proposal for policymakers. I don’t understand why the media would use tactical framing for this. It’s really not a democrat/republican thing. It’s just improving the quality of life of people and the earth in general. Tactical framing prevents people from actually reading the content because all viewers focus on is politics. This allows people like Trump to call Green New Deal out and tweet about it ending the military, cows, cars, and planes. We should help undeveloped countries develop in a green way, like Gore tried with India and Solar City, and like how Naomi Klein purports. We’ve gotten rich off of hurting other people through carbon emissions, so we have to use our wealth to help them develop too. However, even if we’re selfish and don’t want to focus on people in Bangladesh not contributing much to the crisis (for example, we eat 265lb meat/year/american compared to 4lb meat/year/person in Bangladesh, and there are 40 million people starving in Bangladesh), we could be helping ourselves. As shown in the Green New Deal, where workers get more rights and the frontline and vulnerable communities are protected and not left behind in the transition to a greener economy. This would decrease the current disparities and improve life quality overall. The Green New Deal needs to be strong and specific from the start so people like Trump won’t be able to make false accusations. Also, if there is dissent about the content, it can be fixed or diluted.


<br><hr>
I agree that the Green New Deal is clear in what the problems of climate change are and how we can mitigate them. Before this weeks videos and readings, I honestly hadn’t thought about how making these national environmental decisions would affect the economy and people’s jobs. I’m glad to know that the people writing this bill did think of that, and they made it vital that we protect people’s jobs and their lives in the process of protecting the planet. I don’t see why anyone would belittle this plan. Yes, these changes will cost a lot of money, but they will save us even more in the long run as we saw with Project Drawdown. I think that the Green New Deal outlines changes that we must put into action.
           <br><br>

I was shocked by the differences that Ken stated between Bangladesh and the US. It just goes to show how the richest countries have created the worst problems for our planet in general, but mostly for underdeveloped countries. The US has become a role model for how other countries want to industrialize and in doing so we are responsible for putting 25% of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, much at the expense of countries like Bangladesh. I think that the US should be not only responsible but held accountable for helping other countries industrialize in a green way. I think that it is literally the least we can do to help other countries from exacerbating the problem that we started.

Of all the readings for this class, I feel like this one has been the most significant for me. I had heard of the Green New Deal before, but I had never gone out of my way to read it or even research what was on it. I expected a detailed plan of every policy that should be enacted and dates, including something like the Carbon Tax and climate labels on food/clothing. However, the bill was nothing like that; it was mostly a brief introduction into the impact the U.S. has made on the climate, as well as what measures need to be done to mitigate the crisis before it surpasses the 2 degrees celsius “limit”. Something I never imagined on the bill was that it included a section regarding climate justice, and how to protect the people who are most vulnerable to climate change. Although Resolution 109 was only a small portion of it, I think the Green New Deal is an incredibly influential step in the cultural changes our country needs to make. It addressed some of the largest issues we have talked about in class, such as the agricultural industry, transportation, and vulnerable communities. In regards to Ken’s question, I think we very much need to make the changes presented in the Green New Deal -- but we need to take it a step further, not only protecting our country, but communities such as Bangladesh, which will suffer from the consequences of our fossil fuel economy. Unfortunately, as we saw in the videos for this week, changing our economy is already a huge challenge in the political climate of today; I can only imagine how difficult it will be to pass bills that will give aid to developing countries.

I think that there is tremendous power in a resolution. Even compared to a traditional bill or other form of legislation, a resolution is immensely impactful because it is defined by two main contents: an acknowledgement and a promise. For example, this resolution, and therby the Green New Deal both acknowledges that climate change will have intense impacts on the entire planet (but especially on certain at-risk regions/groups/etc.) but also outlines a series of goals that must be reached. This resolution could serve as the beginning of a model where the United States returns to the status of “global role model” with respect to climate change, a designation I believe was lost shortly after the election of Donald Trump. 
           <br><br>
I also expected more logistical details and formalities when I began reading but I fully agree that it was far more effective to outline the social, cultural, and historical factors that are at play in the form of climate justice. With that being said, and in response to Ken’s main question, I do believe that there is still a significant amount of work to be done domestically before we can maximize our international support and influence. That’s not to say we can’t help other countries in this process now, but rather that our current trajectory is still not conducive enough to global success. Therefore, we should be overhauling domestic changes before turning our full attention globally, at least until this resolution can be carried out to a more legitimate extent.

I found the Green New Deal to be a well rounded plan for curbing the amount of environmental damage created by the United States. Although its main source of controversy would ultimately be about politics in the United States, it did propose a lot of good ideas regarding sustainable farming, lowering carbon emissions released, and helping people get jobs with living wages after changes in energy use. The overall proposal on paper seems extremely promising and covers the area of environmental and social justice as it aims to help the poor in the country and ensure that everyone has access to clean water and would strengthen the labor force. However, if this was put into action (which is already wary as it seems to become more of a political issue rather than a concern of the humanity of the people and safety of the planet), I am unsure if it would be effective, as companies and higher-ups would find ways to work around these regulations and still find ways to exploit workers and damage the planet. We as the people have to hold those in charge accountable for their actions if they do try to be above the law. It is sad that we are exploiting those in other countries for cheap production and environmental damage for our own benefit. Putting the Green New Deal into action would not only help the environment and those in the US, but also those living in poor conditions and working for low wages in other countries that the US is dependent on.

After reading the Green New Deal I was surprised because before reading it I thought it was just about climate change, but it wasn’t. It talks a lot about the economic side and how much everything will cost if we keep going down the same path. It also talks about equality and to promote justice. I find this very interesting about the government promoting this because it raises attention to low income workers that don’t have as much to do with the climate crisis but they are being fully affected by it. I also like how the Green New Deal lists many goals that the American people can start to follow. It raises attention to every issue and lists goals for each issue and the consequences if we don’t follow the goals. I feel like this will encourage many people to follow the goals because if they don’t they will know how it will affect the planet and the next generations. I really enjoyed the Green New Deal because it didn’t just list climate change solutions, but it had a variety of different topics that could benefit the planet.

We have talked about “The Green New Deal” in class a few times, but I never really understood the details of it. This weeks reading really shined a light on what this deal is and how it will be implemented. I was really impressed with how many climate and social issues that this document covered. I originally thought it would only be about the climate crisis but it also covers social injustices against minorities, low-income areas, and the gender wage gap. The readings, films, and lectures this quarter have been a constant reminder for our dire need of politically powered individuals who support aid for the climate crisis. Reading through the Green New Deal and knowing that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez herself, aka a badass queen, is on board and vocalizing for this effort gave me that bit of hope I was looking for. Learning about a crumbling planet every week gets to a point where you feel like no matter who does what, nothing will change and we are doomed. Even though this issue now has a fighting face we have to do our part and fight against our consuming human nature and practice the “de-growth” that Ken is talking about. Our desire to live a “rich and meaningful life” can stay, but what we consider to make us “rich" and what we consider to be “meaningful" needs to change. What if in order to live a “rich and meaningful life” meant fighting for equality, opportunity, and health for all people. If we remove this individualistic mindset, would living a meaningful life mean we are devoted to helping others and offering protection to the land that we occupy? It is our job as a human being to be smarter and think harder, so why are we putting these traits into the wrong things? As Ken states, we have the wealth to protect ourselves from the climate crisis we have brought upon this planet yet have taken little action to do so. Our inability to take responsibility for the suffering of places like Bangladesh have been fatal, it is our job as a “super power” to lead with example and our only example so far is how to be destructive.

The global economy does not serve all people equally. Under current policies, rules, market dynamics, and corporate power structures, economic disparities may widen and environmental degradation may increase. The changing climate has caused severe damage around the world and threatens survival. The decarbonization of the global economy will require a substantial increase in public investment, especially in clean transportation, energy and food systems. This needs to be supported by effective industrial policies, including targeted subsidies, tax incentives, loans and guarantees, and accelerated investment in research, development and technological transformation

The Green New Deal and this video bring up the importance the U.S. has on the rest of the world despite being so small. Therefore, it should be our responsibility to make sure not only play our part in fixing the corruption we have caused but insure the safety of everyone we use to fuel our addiction to consumerism especially to those who are the most vulnerable. It was not shocking to hear more 99 percent of reefs on Earth will be lost and that the U.S. is the most responsible which is sad. Additionally, hearing Ken inform me that the U.S. eats 66 times along with the other facts provided in this week's reading makes the Green New Deal more relevant to us. It is reassuring that the government has taken action and set goals to ensure climate change won't worsen.While it feels like a step in the right direction, many people, including myself question if the people in power will follow through with their plans. Ken has mentioned multiple times in this class that we are approaching the warming of 2 degrees at an alarming rate and this seems especially scary after reading the possibilities that were predicted to happen. We also saw the ugly side third world countries have to pay for at our country's expense. The point made of climate justice and how privileged we are as a country to be protected against the majority of natural disasters while many countries aren't is absurd when we've contributed the most to this problem causing these disasters. I feel every person that lives in the United States has a responsibility to make an effort to change to a more sustainable lifestyle as well as the government to use their power efficiently to control the issue at hand.

The reading for this week was quite interesting in that finding out the actual tenets of the GND helps change my perspective on the entire climate movement. However, I wanted to moreso touch upon the idea of the economy that is brought up within this video, and how sustainable it is in its current form. Everyone tauts a constantly growing economy as an inherent good, and it certainly is in terms of raising our standard of living. But it most certainly comes at a cost, as there is always an opportunity cost in economics. With our current infrastructure, we have limited ourselves to relying on the fossil fuel industry to provide all of our power because the executives decided to continue exploiting the environment instead of switching over when they had the perfect opportunity. However, as we are currently seeing, fossil fuels will not last forever nor are they sustainable. We had forgone the notion of switching over to renewables and are now struggling to set the initiative in motion because it would require a massive amount of resources and instability within our economy to make that shift. But the question is, it is our planet, so what price do you set on that? No price is far too great to save the world we all live on.

I completely agree. Why do we automatically assume that growth is good? We don't look at where growth comes from, who it goes to, and what it's consequences are. Often times, growth comes from the exploitation of foreign workers who don't have legal protections that keep them from being paid next to nothing. Often times, growth goes to the top 1%. In today's dollars, in fact, the typical American is still making roughly the same as they were in the late 20th century, despite the fact that America's economy has grown since then. Often times, growth leads to the environment being destroyed. Oil is the easiest example of this. If we are to solve climate change we must first shift our view that uninhibited growth is fundamentally good. It really depends on what that growth looks like.

The Green New Deal seems like a good start. It has many of plans for healthier and more eco-friendly practices, but most of the practices they wish to enact are the more mainstream carbon savers like green energy or electric cars which we have seen also have a massive carbon footprint. The plan to stop taking advantage of the less fortunate in destitute areas would probably help them, but at the same time may deprive them of jobs they need. I don’t know much about outsourced workforces, but I don’t think they would take the job if they didn’t have a choice. This seems to be more of a societal issue than an eco issue. I also wonder where we would get the money to create these changes. Many of the wishes in the Green New Deal seem necessary, but expensive. I wouldn’t mind a tax increase if it means giving my countrymen clean water, but moving production to the US would greatly increase prices and put the burden on consumers. With the amount of power businesses have in congress, it would be difficult to get that portion ratified.

The Green New Deal was actually a very straightforward, easy read. Simply put, if we don't make changes and implement them as soon as humanly possible, rise in global temperatures will cause massive death and destruction. If the global temperature increases more than 2 degrees Celsius beyond preindustrialized levels, it will cause "wildfires that, by 2050, will anually burn at least twice as much forest area in the western United States than was typically burned by wildfires in the years preceding 2019" and "more than 350,000,000 more people [will be] exposed globally to deadly heat stress by 2050." These statements were especially alarming to me because 2050 is not even that far away; in only 30 years, we will face major destructive consequences of climate change. Climate change is happening right now, and we need to put the Green New Deal and other pro-environmental policies into action as soon as possible. Even though reducing our meat consumption and air travel is also importnat, the most important thing we can do right now is vote for people who acknowledge climate change and will support these policies in the years to come.

I am very disappointed in myself because prior to having taken this course I wrote the Green New Deal off. I saw it as a rookie congresswoman using this as a way to establish herself in her new career in politics in a plan that would cost the United States a tremendous amount of money in what is global issue, and therefore would be a waste of that tremendous amount of money as we would need the same action from those other countries like China, India, and Russia. However, I just made these accusations in my head without realising the impact this deal can make. First of all, the United States has the worst carbon footprint because not only do we rank in the top 3 in carbon emissions on our own but our consumerism then adds to the carbon emissions of other countries notably China and India. Not only that, but we are considered leaders in terms of international relations and for that reason action by us through the Green New Deal has a strong chance of influencing other nations into doing the same. 
           <br><br>
In regards to climate justice, in my opinion this is the most important issue that we are going to face. The fact that the wealthiest individuals have the largest carbon footprint and the poorest have the smallest, yet the poorest will feel the effects the most. This infuriates me, and the United States will be nothing short of evil if they are unwilling to help.

As I was reading the Green New Deal, I saw many connections to most if not all of the readings and lectures that we have had prior. In David Wallace wells article, he talked extensively on heat death being one of the biggest problems that we would face globally had the global temp. gone above 2 degrees Celsius. Personally, I had not heard too much about the Green New Deal prior to reading it, so it was quite fitting that this class brought it to more of my attention. The format was pretty easy to grasp for the everyday reader and it gave much information that you had already presented to us. I do agree that we need a culture change, I just personally think that the most realistic approach to saving the planet is to heavily implement the use of renewables because I believe that it is nearly impossible to massively reduce meat consumption in the united States.

Before viewing the short films this week and then actually reading the Green New Deal today, I hadn't really known what the content of the resolution was. Now that I have educated myself on the content of this resolution, I can say that it definitely seems like a big step in the right direction. This shows that Congress (at least part of it) recognizes the issues caused by the climate crisis and has some ideas of where solutions can come from. Like Ken does in this video, the Green New Deal also brings up the point that the US played a large role in bringing the world to the state that it is in now. It seems completely backwards that someone from the US can eat more than 66 times as much meat as someone from Bangladesh, but Bangladesh will face the bulk of consequences from climate change. 5,000 people die annually from flooding in Bangladesh and we just sit back and eat our Big Macs. Every action has a consequence, even if the consequence doesn't directly affect the person doing the action. The Green New Deal is the first step towards the first world acknowledging the damage it's done and doing something about it.

I always thought that the United States wasn't as susceptible to the effects of climate change due to a significantly milder, less sporadic climate. While this isn't completely false, I never took into consideration that it was also our wealth and infrastructure that allowed us to stay safe from the relentless Earth. I knew that California was constantly on fire but never quite realized why so few had such an influential effect on our lives It is now that I realize it is because we can afford all the resources and human capital necessary to combat such fires. On a global scale, we are probably the most equipped to handle most natural disasters. Unfortunately, as stated by the video, this isn't the case for many other nations such as Bangladesh.
            <br><br>
The more I learn about the climate crisis, the more I realize  how responsible MDCs are for the degradation of our  planet. The only reason we don't care is because we are capable of mitigating the effects it has on our lives. Furthermore, even with knowledge of how terrible the climate change can potentially get, we still make no action because it still has yet to actually affect us. We see events such as the Australian Wildfires but don't make meaningful action because  we don't see a reason to. 
           <br><br>
I think the Green New Deal does a good job of connecting the concepts of Social Justice, environmental justice, and climate justice. When addressing the issue of climate change, it talks about all of the forms of injustice that would ensue for , not just us, but the entire world. It talks about how we are the cause of an inexplicably large portion of greenhouse house emissions  and how it may have a great effect on the entire planet. People need to stop acting as if this is a singular issue with one outcome. There are people suffering all over the globe due to our actions and we need to fix it.

After reading “The Green New Deal”, It was impressive to read “The United States must take a leading role in reducing emissions through economic transformation.” I strongly agree with this statement since the U.S was, is and still will be the  leading model country for a lot of years in the world. Also, by being one of the most great emission countries, the U.S. has even more responsibilities to make changes first. I also like how this reading discusses many materials we have discussed in class. I also agree with the concept of “degrowth” being a necessity for our culture. This idea reminds me with the film of minimalism and helps me understand that there is not much room for adding more to our society. Overall, it is really happy to see the government tried to address what we would do to fix the inevitable consequences of converting the whole economy. And I also like how they stated the ways to help protect the animals and ecosystems. On the other hand, even though these are all theoretically fine, they still could be challenged easily. For instance, Trump decided to be out of the Paris Accord two years ago, and no one could do anything about it.

Frankly, I disagree with the idea of the US needing to take a leading role due to the way it sets an example for other nations. We need to acknowledge the other nations before us that did it first and did it better, such as Germany, Costa Rica, and indigenous peoples' efforts to mitigate carbon emissions and end the climate crisis. I agree that we must take a leading role simply due to our massive contributions to climate change, both directly in terms of sheer emissions and indirectly by our international policy which prioritizes fossil fuels and economic gain over the lives of not only our own people, but over the human rights and lives of millions of civilians residing in the Middle East. 
            <br><br>

I also enjoyed how cohesive the Green New Deal was in addressing other pieces of climate literature and pertinent articles regarding climate change. It is thorough yet concise in addressing the consequences, the solutions, and the impacts on individual lives both in and out of the USA. One of my favorite parts about this is probably the fact it is posed as a reiteration of FDR's New Deal, which was seen as a large, government-powered, wide-scale economic solution to the negative impacts on the general American population. I think that b posing this as economically beneficial it will be much easier to pass this legislation through Congress.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. The fact that more than 350,000,000 people will be exposed globally to deadly heat stress by 2050 is shocking, and among most people that would be affected by climate change and suffer are from the third world countries. Since these countries have only produced less than 5% of the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere right now, it is a social, environmental, and climate injustice. The United States as the biggest emitter in the world who has released 25% of the carbon emission must take a leading role in reducing emissions through economic transformation as mentioned in “The Green New Deal”. Not only will this encourage more countries to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in fair ways, but also will create millions of jobs, reducing the unemployment rate and ensuring economic security. Needing a country that is able to lead the whole world to act is as significant and urgent as needing a climate vanguard that is able to influence the people around him or her to act. Only working together both on a large scale and a small scale can human best mitigate the climate crisis.

I really can't emphasize how happy I am that we FINALLY talk more about environmental justice and the Green New Deal. Putting aside the actual content of the resolution itself, it's very helpful that the legislation is short and also uses language that is understandable--it doesn't feel like legislation when you read it. 
            <br><br>

There's so much that could be said about the Green New Deal that I don't know what aspect of it. One of the arguments I always feel is brought up when talking about climate action is "it costs too much money--the economy will tank," but it's so ironic ? ? ? Because if we don't take any action to combat the climate crisis there will be no economy at all. The consequences of not taking action far outweigh any action we may take. 
            <br><br>

The thing I admire the most about the GND is its emphasis on the social aspect of the climate crisis, specifically social and environmental justice. It's so important to recognize and understand that some communities are disproportionately impacted by the consequences of climate crisis. The GND does exactly that and seeks to elevate marginalized communities while also transitioning into a green society. The "fair and just transition" part of the resolution is very critical. There is already such a high level of inequality in this country and if we were to transition into a greener economy without considering the people on the frontlines then we risk making those inequalities even larger. For instance, the GND would make it so that folks who work in coal mines are able to find new jobs. I also love that the GND takes an intersectional approach to the climate crisis because climate change is sort of this umbrella for a myriad of other social justice issues like racial/wealth/gender inequality and issues like rising housing prices, affordable healthcare, etc. The GND recognizes and addresses that. 
            <br><br>

I know the resolution receives tons and tons of criticism, but frankly who else besides AOC has put forth even half a plan to combat the climate crisis? As I mentioned earlier, we have to take some sort of action to combat the climate crisis and social issues or it'll be a matter of decades before we don't have a livable planet.

I also felt more refreshing after this week's reading. It actually surprised me that some politicians are not only aware of the climate issues, but are also actively taking actions on help building a brighter future, those who wrote it should have all our support and respects. 

            <br><br>


In contrast, there are politicians in power who are too shortsighted to see the price of transforming are nothing compare to the price of recovering, that is as you said, if we even have a chance to recover. It's sad some people just don't see that how important it is for U.S., one of the most developed country in the world, to be the first one that make changes. In my opinion, the Green New Deal is definitely the first step need to be made, though not agreed by people who make climate change sound as insignificant as possible, or thinking that quitting Paris Agreement is a good idea. Indeed in the process of transforming there will always be setbacks like these. But this is only the first step we haven't even take, and how much time is left for us before it's too late? So yeah I agree with you that we have to take actions regarding climate and social issues.

After watching Ken's video, I found the environmental and climate injustices appears in a lot of places. Because the US is a developed country, it produced far more greenhouse gases than the third-world countries. At the same time, US population only equal to 4 percent of world population, but this group emits a large percent of world greenhouse gases emission. In short, the average greenhouse gases emission of each US citizen is at a high rate compared with citizens in developing countries. I believe this is where the climate injustices comes from. The outcome of climate crisis is usually experienced by people who live in third-world countries. I think it is very unfair to them because they only produce a small amount of greenhouse gases and they have to bear the bad outcome which developed countries left over. I feel sad and helpless because I am unable to do something to help to solve this problem. The only solution right now is to eliminate the carbon footprint we created and try our best to reduce the impact of climate change reflected on third-world countries and pour areas. Therefore, I believe everyone should focus on the problem of climate change and start some actions today.

When AOC came out with the Green New Deal, I remember how moved many people around me were. We were all so thrilled and impressed with her. A young, new, fresh member of Congress actually acknowledged all these systematic disparities within our nation (something that our older congressmen would never do) and created a piece of legislation that materialized these concerns into a action items. Just as I remember hearing about the Green New Deal, I also remember hearing about how many feathers were ruffled as a result of it coming into fruition. Fox News, other Republican congressmen etc. were ready to criticize the legislation for its ineffectiveness. To some extent, I agree with this sentiment. I think AOC is a visionary and all successful governments need someone to dream big while the other to execute in order to make strides forward. This legislation, while a product of what many of us think and feel bogged down by, address way too much and doesn’t hone in on a few attainable actions. It’s a good source of ethos in that it overwhelms us into action, but can have the adverse effect of debilitating congressmen and the average person into inaction. I think a follow up resolution where we focus on just one or two things is essential. 
            <br><br>

To address Ken video, I think the environmental disparities are something that we certainly caused and certainly have to fix. The way in which we fix it, however, is the important part. All throughout history, we have seen America be the “missionary” and “savior” when really we intervene in foreign affairs often under the guise of good, but for self benefit. I think if we are to help nations like Bangladesh, we must effectively communicate with them to see in which ways they need assistance. We can sway them into making environmentally good choices, but in addition to just influencing their bills and legislation, we must provide them with the materials, funding, and other resources they request. We cannot just advise and then leave, just like we cannot intervene to the extent that we are overshadowing the nation into believing that we know more than they do within their own communities. We should focus on designing WITH, not designing FOR when it comes to community solutions.

Hi Nickita, I, along with you, was very impressed and excited when AOC, a freshman congresswomen, introduced the Green New Deal. It still blows my mind that no one before her had tried to introduce such a bill, even though we have known since the 1900s that our Earth is in climate peril. Me, being a political science major, heard all different types of news coverage on the Green New Deal ranging from political and social praise to Fox news ripping it apart section by section. I will never understand how the climate crisis has become a partisan issue, but all I know now is there we all need to take action in getting the Green New Deal passed. But, as Ken mentioned in his lecture video, the Green New Deal is primarily focused on the United States and not about the social, environmental, and climate injustice that we are causing on developing countries around the world. I believe that the Green New Deal is a great and necessary first step in the US combating with climate change, but I do not believe that it can be the only steps we need to take. In order to combat this horrifyingly global issue, we need to do more to fix the injustice of it all by stepping up and accepting every point to the Green New Deal and more. We need to fix and make up for the horrors that we have caused on other countries, like Bangladesh, and do everything in our power to stop the climate crisis.

After reading “The Green New Deal'', I thought the proposed bill seems very well structured on what goal it hopes to achieve. I think the implementation of this bill would be a really good step towards decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions and helping turn around the negative impact we have placed on the planet. I think  it was very important they address how the economy might be affected and the importance to jobs. Since many argue that without big  fossil fuel industries the economy would decline and many would lose their jobs. I think that is one of the main reasons why many are unsure of and oppose the green new deal bill. 
             <br><br>

I was shocked to hear Ken say that 18 percent of the country of Bangladesh gets flooded and 5000 people are killed each year besides 6 million homes being destroyed, that's horrifying. All of this being caused by the rise of sea levels that is caused by the climate crisis so many ignore. It is concerning that these kinds of events are not being talked about globally. If more people saw the very real effects of the climate crisis , they would be more inclined to get involved and learn about what is happening. Also if more people are compelled by the horrible consequences of the climate crisis, there would be more public support and people in influential positions would have no choice, but to address it. I think if the public puts pressure on the government to take action that would then allow serious actions to be taken such as the Green New Deal bill passing and being enforced. I think the Green New Deal bill is a realistic solution for the climate crisis that could make a positive impact if passed.

The bill did cover important points and gave many options as to how to improve the environment to secure a better future. I was very pleased to see that it brought up, and in a way demanded, justice and equity of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth. It took me back to week five when we watched the documentary “The True Cost” and I just pictured all of those people working in horrible conditions and for little to no pay. I do hope we can spread this knowledge to as most people as possible so, like you said, people in influential positions would have no choice but to address it, and then potentially we can begin to fix the damage we have caused.

After watching that video, I do have a lot of feelings. Every time I watch these videos, I can deeply understand how bad people's impact on the environment is now and how urgent it is to protect the environment. But if we really want to protect the environment, as we wrote in this week's reading materials, it will inevitably affect economic development, then I think any The world's governments will not really adopt these methods or even ignore them as they saw in last week's movie, and then continue to do things that harm the environment. If so, those methods are useless. I know that those methods in the article seem to protect the environment and increase economic development, but they are not, because As said in last week's movie, as long as we take action to protect the environment, we will inevitably cut off several roads, which will inevitably affect economic development, so I think it's really too difficult to protect the environment without reducing, or even increasing, economic growth, so the method mentioned in this article is a good dream, but it's good to see In reality, it's unrealistic, so I don't think these methods will really be adopted, so we need more practical methods.

Hi, I find it interesting how you mentioned that these methods (referring to methods of protecting the environment) are useless. I understand that each world government would not want to give up on or lose their economic progress. But I believe that change must happen eventually and will eventually happen.  If we want to protect the environment, it will affect our economic development. Sacrifices must be made for the greater good, and I feel that we need to make a commitment and a shared understanding to what we are fighting for. People don't realize that this crisis threatens mankind and it is going to be far more devastating than what we have ever experienced. In the future at this rate, people around the world won't be rewarded with a self powering economy and a planet with livable conditions.

This weeks reading, The Green New Deal, was something that I have heard talked about before and the benefits that can come from this. However, I myself have not read nor understood the actual deal and was my first time reading it. It contains very valuable information and information that I genuinely believe will help with the crisis. There are actual people that are in positions of power and want to help change the way that things are. That allows for the feeling of hopefulness and that there might actually be change. When hearing the video, it only reminded me how much fortune we have being Americans and I only end up thinking about how much damage we do to the rest of the world. We should definitely help the third world countries that we have thrown all our waste and trash too in order to help them rebuild from the things that we have caused. We have to realize that we can not keep doing this and that the damage that we have caused will come back to affect us at the end of the day, sooner than we think.

I also feel better knowing that they are politicians in power who have our best interest at heart. Green New Deal is very comprehensive and I am sure it will gain traction if we elect the right president. The conservative media has been working hard at making sure that they convince their audience that the Green New Deal will be detrimental to us. I hope that people will see through the propaganda and actuallly educate themselves on this topic. I hate to say it but the media does not help us. We look to them to tell us the truth but their news networks have deals with companies in the fossil fuel industry. It is up to us to educate the community on what it is being proposed in the Green New Deal.

I think a good point made in this video is that we need to tailor solutions to every problem because not every problem can be solved by the same solution. Like how California will soon have its own GND. UCSB will soon have its own GND. EcoVista will also have such. I think it's good to compare a lot of times what's happening in USA and what is happening outside of this country but it is also important that people don't come with a sense of pity and "saviorism". These people will be fine if USA and other European countries stop exploiting their labor and start seeing value in all the work that they do. Instead, here we are, giving them money so they can build more factories to provide USA the demand it needs. Moreover, if USA can't even take care of the residents of its land and the original custodians that took care of the land before it, then it's nonetheless still a failed government. You can NOT help anyone else if you don't help yourself.

Injustice plagues our modern world today. As Ken mentions, injustice takes various forms whether it be social, environmental, or climate justice. Whereas the general public in the United States has been exposed to the concept of social justice in our past, the idea of environmental justice and climate justice are relatively new ideas that many have still not been exposed to. I think about these ideas in the sense of an uneven distribution, and this happens on a global scale. While we in the States have the funds and resources to combat environmental disasters, many developing countries can not afford the same luxury. It is a travesty that, at the same time, many developing countries ,for example the countless island nations in Oceania, are also the ones who are feeling the impact of climate change the most. Unfortunately, this is the reality we live in, and time would be better used doing something to change this injustice rather then wasting time lamenting about it. Like Ken said, we in the US are in the unique position to spearhead this injustice because we are where much of the world looks as a model for a developed country. While one way to help this injustice would be to provide financial aid and packages to disaster struck countries, that would not help solve the issue. It would only help with disaster relief. The only way we can really help spur change and combat this injustice is to make strides culturally towards a sustainable culture that can be used as a model by other high emitter developed countries.

In reading the Green New Deal the thing that got my attention the most was the first part of the legislation. As someone who follows politics fairly regularly and has known and supported the Green New Deal I have read it before and known the various ideas and projects that it proposes the government takes action in funding but what jumped out at me the most in re-reading it was the first half of the legislation that addresses the United States' responsibility and acknowledgement of climate change and what we have done to create the problem. I think that this is an important step because if it was put into legislation that the U.S. recognizes that climate change exists and is a cause of our actions (specifically the U.S.) then when any politician or president gets elected they cannot outright reject the claim of acknowledgement of climate change without striking down the bill. The Green New Deal also focuses on environmental and social justice as it explains how a slim percent of Americans have benefited in corporate profits at the expense of everyone who now has to combat this problem of climate change and how people with less resources (the poor and the middle-class) are more susceptible to the damages climate change can cause. In this video that dives into more of the issues surrounding climate and social injustice, I was shocked by some of the statistics that Ken brought up that compared the U.S. to Bangladesh and how we have contributed to climate change as a society versus how they have contributed to the issue. Given the plan or at least the outlines of a plan put forward by the Green New Deal that acknowledges the environmental injustice aspect of climate change, I think it is then important for us Americans to take individual action and vote into office public officials and politicians who believe in the Green New Deal and who are willing to take a stand against inaction in regards to climate change and push for environmental justice.

Reading the policies of the Green New Deal made me a little  more hopeful in regards to fixing climate change and climate injustices. I’m glad that there are politicians like Representative Ocasio-Cortez who I feel genuinely care about the fairness of the policies they support and the people they represent. Although individual change contributes a lot to changing climate change, supporting certain politicians who support modern policies like the Green New Deal also makes a great difference. I have hope that with these upcoming elections, voters will elect politicians who care more about fulfilling their duties  to the people they represent than those who their attention is  solely on money and big businesses. I was glad they included  the list of potential damage the U.S.A will face because of climate change. Especially, the use of actual monetary values. Unfortunately, for some people, reading that the US could potentially lose around a billion dollars in public infrastructure and coastal real estate, is the only way to get them to listen.  What shocked me was the paragraph in the deal in which it acknowledges that the U.S is responsible for a “disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions.” Nowadays, many politicians try and avoid the topic of climate change all together, not blatantly call out the United States for being a huge part of the problem. We shouldn’t feel offended or attacked as Americans  because it is the truth. Millions of people are losing their homes and their lives because of climate change in places like Bangladesh, in part,  because of our actions. As the Green New Deal pointed out, Climate justice is also an important issue that is being brought to light more and more. It is the federal governments duty to enact/enforce policies and laws that will combat climate change in a way that is fair for all communities. Although there are aspects of the Green New Deal that may be seen as flawed or questionable to some, it is a step in the right direction towards what the Government should look like.

After reading the actual proposal that was put out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change within the House of Representatives, I have a deeper understanding of the Green New Deal legislation. Headed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the piece of legislation is probably the most climate focused piece ever published and proposed by politicians. Unlike typical politicians who want to squash the movement because they receive money from fossil fuel interests and they are scared to lose their seats due to the cost of saving the climate, the endorsers of this legislation are actually very brave in pushing the Green New Deal. 
             <br><br>
I specifically liked the part where it focuses on what the federal government can do, should do, and needs to do in order to resolve the climate crisis. Some of the specific ones,  "Achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through fair transition
", I think is very fair and is definitely the role of the US government to lead the climate change movement. If the government, our elected leaders, doesn't lead in the change, how will the people proceed?
I also specifically noticed a sentence that details a goal to be: "Promote international exchange of technology with the aim of making US the international leader on climate change
." This sentence reflects the continuing mindset that US is the greatest and the strongest, and needs to remain that way--despite the fact that the US is the largest polluter of the climate in history. If anything, the US needs to be the international leader in climate change because of the damage its done, it should not be because the US wants to remain a leading world power. 
With everything, I think the Green New Deal is very revolutionary considering the slow-pace and denial rhetoric of the federal government, but I think that more specific guidelines, limits, and rules need to be laid out for real change.

I agree with you that the endorsers of the Green New Deal are very brave because they're standing up to the norms our society has implemented into our minds and are trying to propose something that will not only benefit us but everyone in the world. I feel that the only reason why many people and politicians are scared to follow through with this plan is that it is very risky and they might be thinking that they'll lose their jobs because of it. The fact that one of the goals of the Green New Deal is to provide people with jobs in renewable energy, should make the people working in the coal mines and in other harsh working environments quickly get on board and support politicians trying to push for this legislation. There really is no reason for people to not be on board with the Green New Deal because of all the promising things it can do for our world, such as, meeting 100% of the power demand in the U.S through clean energy, overhauling transportation systems, repairing and upgrading infrastructure and building resiliency against catastrophes, restoring ecosystems and basically cleaning up our home. Also I believe that in order to get support from more people such as conservatives, they had to include that the U.S. would be the "international leader on climate change". These people think the U.S is the best and the number one country in the world even though there is a huge inequality in income, we are destroying the lives of many people in third world countries and the life expectancy is declining. I do agree with you that more specific guidelines and rules need to be laid out because I find it appalling how the U.S is thriving at the expense of people's lives outside of our country. There shouldn't be the three categories of hunger, starvation and chronic hunger, we should focus on helping everyone because we're all equal.

Reading “The Green New Deal” was actually quite informative and I found it pretty simple and easy to read, which I was not expecting at all. After hearing Ken mention it during class as well as being mentioned in the films we have watched for this class I thought it only focused on what the United States must do to combat the climate crisis, but reading it this week it surprised me to see how it included various social areas such as minorities, economic securities and health benefits. As to the questions Ken offered at the end of his video I think that since the  United States has been a huge contributor to the climate crisis, the United States does have to be held accountable and should help other countries establish some sort of law for degrowth but we also need to enforce some laws degrowth in the United States itself.

I feel the same! I was shocked by its length and how simple it looked. When I think of bills and stuff, I always groan in my head because I have the impression that any piece of political writing must be complicated and partially trying to trick you. In the past, although I viewed the Green New Deal in a positive light, I had never actually read it like many other people. After all, we're told so much about it. We probably already know what it's about just from news and hearsay, right? I was under the impression that the Green New Deal was about the environment, and I supported it because it was good for the environment. Of course, I did worry about how it would prices and stuff if it got passed. Yet, imagine my surprise when I was told in the Vox videos that it wasn't legislation and couldn't actually be passed. 
             <br><br>
The biggest surprise came from actually reading it. Like many others, I was surprised to see that it included other social issues and took into consideration the effects of living for the climate. I'd always thought that anything related to legislation would be gloomy, cryptic, and serious, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Green New Deal was quite positive and uplifting. I can't even imagine how awesome life would be if we lived in a world where we achieved everything the Green New Deal has.
             <br><br>

In terms of helping other countries and taking responsibility, I can see why many people wouldn't want to. After all, my generation is going to end up paying for something we didn't realize was harmful. Yet, we can't just ignore the issue. In this video, the one thing that stood out to me the most and had the greatest impact was: more than 5,000 people in Bangladesh are killed each year due to sea level rise. 
             <br><br>

I've heard about sea level rise, but it always seemed less significant than other issues, like heat death or famine. I knew Bangladesh was being threatened by sea level rise, but I didn't expect thousands of death in a year. After all, Florida, despite the videos of the floods, seemed to be doing alright. The Netherlands has dams, so they're not being flooded. Yet, Bangladesh is dying. 
             <br><br>

In a way, it's sad to sea that people don't know about these issues that other countries are facing as a result of climate change. Besides stronger fires, which haven't affected all of California yet, it's hard to notice climate change here. We don't feel fear for sea level rise or the suffering of people in poorer countries.

I totally agree with your perspective on the Green New Deal is too idealistic to realize. The Green New Deal admits the fact that human activity is the major culprit to cause the climate change. Then, it puts forth several resolutions to address not only the climate injustice but also the environmental injustice and social injustice. However, unless most people truly realize the impending situation about the climate change we are facing, the resolutions would be too idealistic to realize. We have learnt that people have already knew the destructive consequences the climate change would bring in 1970s; nevertheless, few of them are willing to change their life-styles and now we are gradually facing the destructions brought by the climate change. Even so, most people are still refusing to admit the climate change are caused by human activities; instead, the hold the view that the climate change is a natural cycle and the activities of human beings are not powerful enough to change the climate. Why would them still be willing to hold those views yet even the evidence on human activities caused by the climate change is presented impeccably? Greed is the reason for that question. The rise of economy is mainly established on the cost of the environment as the first and second industry which includes oil production and food production are the key ingredients towards the development of the economy. Thus, if we switch the focus towards decreasing the emission fo green gases, then we have to encounter the downturn of the economy which is tortuous to people who are used to high standard living life-style. To narrow the injustice mentioned by the Green New Deal means decrease the living standard of the rich and increase the living standard of the poor, which is unacceptable for now due to the fact that most of us are self-centered and selfish, we are only willing to care about the private benefits brought to us and are reluctant to consider the negative externalities generated towards the third party. Only if the fundamental concept of the high living standard changed, which means protecting the environment, reducing the emission of greenhouse gas and narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor are the ways to enhance everyone’s living standard, the Green New Deal can be implemented effectively.

Although I knew some of the content of the Green New Deal, I had never read the whole thing.  To be honest, I was very surprised by the included research and inclusive nature of the document.  While reading, I was struck by how proactive and objective the document is.  It not only calls out the United States on the disproportionate energy consumption, it explores the impact of this on developing countries, which are the ones being significantly impacted by the effects of climate change.  Overall, this document beautifully lays out the repercussions of inaction on climate change while providing a step by step process on how to mitigate and reverse the impacts.

             <br><br>

Unfortunately, I am not so sure that the action necessary in regards to the climate crisis is going to be carried out within the amount of time it needs to.  I might be a pessimist, but I just do not see both developed and developing countries taking on profound cultural change in the hopes of mitigating climate impact, when so many people in power do not recognize the importance of this issue.  To lead the revolution, the United States would need to have a surge of public transportation, a fast transition to sustainable energy sources, and an overall complete change of individual lifestyle.  Each individual would need to significantly cut back on their meat intake, energy consumption, and luxurious lifestyle.  Although some people are starting to transition their way of living, it is not a great enough percentage of the population to make a significant difference.  It makes me so sad that the disparity between developed and developing countries is detrimental to the individuals in developing countries and the earth as a whole.

I too have a pretty pessimistic view in regards to how quickly the United States will respond and take action to help fix this climate crisis. In reading through the Green New Deal, it's interesting to read about the energy consumption in America as well as all of the impacts from this climate crisis, on every country, developed or developing. I also enjoyed reading about all the different political actions that we could take as a country to try and improve the atmosphere, however it does worry me about the possibility of us taking those actions in enough time. I think that its gonna be difficult no matter what to try and reverse the damage that has been done. As you mentioned, the Green New Deal does a great job of listing out the various impacts of the rising CO2 levels. 

             <br><br>

Most of the things that need to be done to help reverse the damage to our environment, will require a sufficient about of change in cultural habits. For example, shifting into a plant-based diet is hugely cultural and will force people to change habits and traditions. In attempts to limit waste and water, and lean away from an over consumerist society, it won't just require a check to build some infrastructure, it will take the entire or at least a good proportion of the population to switch up their habits. Because of that factor, I remain fairly pessimistic in our ability to make the changes that we need to especially in today's political climate. If the Green New Deal is gonna go into effect we need to get a strong backing to the deal and get a full bill written and proposed, but first, we need to get people elected that will make this possible.

<br><hr>

I agree that the Green New Deal is super proactive with the issues we are facing today. There indeed were many shocking factors included in it like some of the things that would directly effect America if the temperature rose more than 2 degrees more than it already has. But I also agree with what you have to say about the necessary action that this Green New Deal calls upon the government. 
             <br><br>
Indeed, the government needs to step in and care more about what is happening... but how can they do that when so many Americans don't care or don't know about what is happening? How can a politician get people to support them on cultural changes that they can't even see themselves doing? This whole argument is just a tough situation that needs to be described in detail to EVERYONE!!!
             <br><br>
More classes like this need to be taught at more schools, in different sates, and in different countries. Looking through the comments on this weeks assignments and past weeks', it is evident that I am not the only person who knew close to nothing about the climate crisis before this class.


<br><hr>

I agree with Olivia, I have always been surrounded by the politics and media around the Green New Deal that I never heard what the Green Deal was actually proposing us to do. I think that I am also a pessimist in the sense that I am also scared that we as a nation will not make the necessary changes in the time period we have left. I know that people care about themselves so they should realize that if the earth fails then so does their life. I was also saddened to see that the undeveloped countries are being faced with such low pay and poor living conditions due to factories and pollution. I can not believe that Bangladesh only eats 4 pounds per year and the United States eats 265 pounds. The crazy thing is that the Santa Barbara fire cost over a million dollars and 8,500 firefighters but those in the undeveloped countries do not have the same support that we do and as a result when natural disasters like when the Plaza collapsed the same care was not given.

             <br><br>

I hope that America realizes the extent of CO2 emissions America is adding to the US and tries to take some initiative and change our future actions. With the up coming election we need changes that will make the next four years the best for the earth and for us. I know Ken and I will both be voting for the New Green Deal .

After reading the Green New Deal and being reminded of how big of a role the United States played in the climate crisis, I feel strongly when I say, “yes, the United States should play a role in helping Bangladesh in terms of flooding and other dangers and problems that were caused from climate change.” I am passionate when I say this because the United States played one of the biggest roles in climate change so the United States should do their part and clean up and fix the mess that they made. It would not be fair if the United States refused to help underdeveloped countries, the countries that suffer the wraths of climate change the most. However, this is not “it.” Along with helping underdeveloped countries that are in need, we must also change our current lifestyle because it is nowhere near sustainable. Like how the video said, the United States must undergo degrowth while helping underdeveloped countries like Bangladesh go through sustainable growth.

While the Green New Deal rightfully acknowledges the negative impact the U.S. has on the environment with its emission of 20% of the the global greenhouse gases through 2014 and believes the Federal Government should take action, the policies itself focus on the economic loss that is predicted to be experienced by the U.S. along with the desire to improve conditions for U.S. citizens. With this recognition, I believe our social responsibility to the world must be treated the same with ourselves in the sense that America must become the leading example that holds accountable the change we must ensure within our nation, especially through this degrowth Ken mentioned. Specifically, solutions to this are included by the Green New Deal with transitioning to 100% clean and renewable energy; however, what it doesn’t explicitly mention is the absolute need to consider switching to a plant-based diet or transform our consumer culture, which holds consequences not only for our own environment but also the lives of citizens in the country and populations globally affected. 
             <br><br>

Most of those affected by our consumer culture through factors like the manufacturing of such products that may not benefit the living conditions of these populations anyways due to the pollution or dangerous working environment. What stood out to me was the statistics for comparison of America to Bangladesh, especially with how obesity affects 40% of Americans while 1 in 10 people across the globe experience chronic hunger daily. This highlights the need to alter our diet and improve upon the flaws in the meat industry or even the wastes created from the food industry as a whole.
             <br><br>

Through going through with such policies upon our nation, I believe America must then contribute globally through returning to previous levels of funding in Bangladesh and sharing environmental laws or policies that direct this transformed America to a cleaner country in order for other countries to follow. While I acknowledge that there are many other countries who have already taken such an initiative and made much more progress, a country like ours with a quarter contribution of greenhouse gas emission must especially be held accountable.

By reading the Green New Deal I came to understand the resolution as a unifying platform for leftist political goals than a serious solution to anthropogenic climate change. While I understand that specificity was not the aim of this resolution, the deal makes broad proclamations that are entirely unsubstantiated and fails to provide anything approaching a method for achieving the goals it lists. I think the primary purpose of this resolution is to realign the leftist movement in the United States around climate change, with the destruction of the planet serving as the impetus for achieving a litany of leftist goals including income inequality, racial inequality, labor rights, and increased government control of the economy. By grounding their policy goals in such a seemingly large threat, the impact of possible rebuttals to these goals is minimized. For instance, common arguments against these various policy proposals, such as raising the minimum wage, are frequently based around damage it would do to the economy and the burden it would place on taxpayers. When you can claim that the literal life of the planet depends on supporting these measures, it is easier to make people ignore the undeniable costs of these proposals. While this isn't necessarily a critique of the resolutions individual points, I think this deal should be viewed as a political tool and messaging campaign than a serious attempt to start actually working on climate policy. 
             <br><br>
If AOC and others actually believe we need to start acting now to address climate change and avoid the worst-case scenario, let's start drafting real legislation supporting specific solutions. There is broad bipartisan support for things such as the expansion of nuclear energy that can quickly reduce our CO2 emissions. Grouping other issues in with climate policy  damages the conversation and makes bipartisan action far less likely to occur.

I actually really enjoyed reading the Green New Deal for this week’s reading. It makes me happy to know that there is some governmental push to help mitigate and address the topic of climate change. How much of it will actually be put into effect–I have no idea. But, with the topic on the table, there were some very good points that were made in the document. I especially liked how comprehensive and specific the document was when it came to its goals and reasoning for the deal. For example, I liked how they addressed how to reduce carbon emission and the environmental impacts that will happen if action is not taken. This to me, really seals the deal on the debate on climate change. If the US congress is finding these reports and the science is clearly pointing to a necessary change, then there is obviously something that we should do about it. I also liked how they addressed the social and economic impact climate change has and mentions the protection of small businesses, health care, and economic security. These are all things that I would have not have associated with climate change, but after reading and listening to Ken’s video, I can now see how these different injustices (social, environmental, and climate) are all interrelated. 

             <br><br>

It makes me mad that the US is largely responsible for much of the carbon emissions and climate change, but are so unwilling to make changes and take action to mitigate the problem at hand. This in itself is an injustice to humanity and all the living creatures that share the planet with us. Although there is more we can be doing as a country, there is very little room for change when the government does not enforce policies that exist to reduce global temperatures. However, with this Green New Deal, I feel a little more hopeful that I will see more government action in handling this problem. I especially also liked how there is a condition outlined in the deal that ensures that “frontline and vulnerable communities shall not be adversely affected”. This is also very important in our fight for climate justice in ensuring that we are not further hurting the vulnerable communities that have already suffered enough from our actions. For these reasons, I highly support the Green New Deal. I would also like to mention how crazy the statistics Ken used in his video are. By the end of watching it, I felt empathetic for the people in Bangladesh and all the other countries that the United States most highly affect. There is a humanitarian crisis in our midst, but the United States has stayed silent on the issue. I hope that there is more change within the system and that the new deal is enforced.

My reaction to reading the Green New Deal was very similar, it is comforting to see that not only was the document very detailed in their plan, but just the overall idea that government action appears to be taking place. It's evident that people are pushing for action already towards saving our environment, but as we learned previously, it's hard for changes to be enacted without the support/action of higher authority (i.e. people who hold a position in office/government). I just hope the government follows through because I have studied before in a politics class about the environment that countries rather piggyback off each other in order to achieve the change they want to see in the environment; no one actually wants to be the one to make the first move or do the work, especially when there aren't any real consequences for not upholding expectations regarding protecting the environment. For example, people may get together and set a goal to not surpass heating to a certain degree/reducing CO2 emissions, such as SB County (the birthplace of modern environmental movement), but as we studied before, they couldn't even follow through with their goals. I feel like government enforcement is something that we need to result to in order to see change. Unfortunately the consequence of our Earth dying isn't alarming enough to persuade people (especially corporations!)  into changing their lifestyles for the good of our planet. 
             <br><br>
Additionally, although it is comforting to know that there's government documents striving to protect our environment, it's a shamed it's not being publicized more. I had no idea about the Green New Deal before this class.

After watching this video, I am convinced that something like the Green New Deal is what we need. The Green New Deal clearly lays out what will happen to our planet if we do not restrict temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. At an increase of just 2 degrees Celsius, sea level rise will cost billions of dollars in damage to infrastructure, millions of people will have to migrate to more habitable locations, wildfires will be much more deadly, burning twice as much area than previous years, and mass extinction of 99 percent of all coral reefs. The future of our planet is not a pretty one. If anything, it is pretty alarming. Soon our entire planet will become inhabitable if we do not start making the necessary changes now. 

             <br><br>

Even with how bad the future of our planet looks, the United States is not doing anything about it. Instead, we have people in power who continue to deny the existence of climate change. We have a President who supports the fossil fuel industry, denies that climate change is real, and is actively working towards destroying all regulations put into place by our predecessors. By turning the issue of climate change and solutions like the Green New Deal into a partisan one, nothing will ever get done. Everyone will be affected by a warming planet that is on its way to becoming inhabitable. Natural disasters will target everyone indiscriminately. It doesn’t matter if you are rich or poor, Democrat or Republican, because at the end of the day, climate change has no sides. 

             <br><br>

I do believe that the United States should be responsible for helping out the less fortunate and developing countries. It is only fair that we help countries like Bangladesh because without them, we wouldn’t be where we are today. It is off their labor and mistreatment of their lands that made our country rich. We took advantage of other countries’ need for employment to benefit ourselves and drive our economy. We as a country, should be the example for the rest of the world to follow. We need to practice what we preach and do our part to not only decrease our greenhouse gas emissions, but to ensure that no one gets left behind.

Hi Sharon, I also agree with you and recognize the importance of a policy like The Green New Deal that can push for effective collective and authoritative actions to combat climate change. In fact, I think the deal is very concise and informative as it lists out problems in which we need to tackle, how we could approach these problems as well as the transitioning needed to ensure social and economical stability after implementing solutions to these problems. Not only does it discuss the technical side of climate change, it also seeks to ensure social, environmental, and climate justice by elaborating on providing welfare to victims of climate change around the world. You focused on the responsibility of developed countries like the US and I think that’s a very good point. The US being one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters should provide assistance to countries like Bangladesh that are greatly effected and vulnerable to climate change. It puzzles me after learning about how the Trump administration cut 2/3 of the original funding to Bangladesh. I think it is also crucial to educate the public on the issues of environmental injustice.

When I looked at the website of this action, the first thing I noticed was the date. It was introduced on Feb. 7, 2019. However, today is Feb. 19, 2020. More than one year, this resolution is just stopped there, and never moves on to the next step. Many people treat the Green New Deal as the political action, and no one is actually looking at its own meaning. This is the answer to how to reduce the greenhouse gases.
             <br><br>

Listening to Ken’s words, the United States is like the “crime” of this climate injustice. We emitted over 25% of global greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, but the poor countries are suffering, which actually belongs to us. The differences between Bangladesh and the U.S. are really sad. Though I am glad that I live in a wealthy country that can protect me from natural disasters, this comfortable life is coming from our fossil fuel companies, and is exchanged by those who died in poor countries.

I literally had the exact same thought. It has been over a year since the Green New Deal, and it seems to me that creating the document was enough. Maybe I am just uneducated on what the government is doing to act on all of the great things they have outlined in the Green New Deal, but it does not feel like much effort is being put toward implementing changes. (After watching the first assigned video "The Green New Deal, explained" I understand why these things have not happened). I think it will solve many of our problems if utilized. It addresses the fault the US has in the progression of the climate crisis, solutions to mitigate the climate crisis, and I particularly like that it emphasizes the need to listen and support those of the "frontline and vulnerable communities." It is fortunate that we are living generally unaffected by the consequences of the climate crisis, but that does not mean we earned the right to sit back and relax. Ken's comparison of the United States to Bangladesh is just one example of the ways the US has sat aside while we reap the benefits of the suffering of poor people and countries. This needs to change in Bangladesh, in our own country, and everywhere else. I am sorry but we have way too much power, money, and opportunity to not fix our mistakes. We have the Green New Deal, now let's use it. Action is the only way things will change. It also seems like personally we cannot do much to enact these types of changes, but we do, by voting, supporting the real eco friendly organizations and companies, and doing our part. It is better to do something than nothing at all. We, the United States of America, need to become the leader in making real change in solving the climate crisis, because we had a large part in creating it and are continuing to today.


<br><hr>
You have pointed out an idea which I haven’t considered! After reading your comment, I realized that the document was published just a little over a year from today. Unfortunately, there aren’t many changes this year. Personally, I don’t find that the government has strived to reach these goals mentioned in the Green New Deal. Although it may be challenging to achieve within a year, I still think that there should be some noticeable improvements in among all these goals.
             <br><br>

On the other hand, I too, am guilty of risking the lives of citizens in developing countries in exchange for our comfortable life in the developed world. When I was watching Ken’s video, I found it disturbing that 18% of the country of Bangladesh flooded each year, in which 5,000 people were killed and 7 million homes destroyed. This disastrous consequences of climate change do not only happen in one day or one year. What makes it worse is that this disaster is happening every single year, destroying more than 75% of the country of Bangladesh while these consequences are not even their fault! Unless we begin to act now, there will be more developing countries or even our developed countries will pay for our destructive wrongdoings.

As I read the Green New Deal, I did agree with the need the address the economic, social and environmental issues, as well as the importance of creating new jobs, while achieving zero net emissions and investing in technology that protects and adapts us to climate change. While I read it, much of it did seem like a stretch and I found myself asking "How?" Essentially, The Green New Deal outlines what we are capable of if actualy put in the work, kind of like an outline and even though its not a polished work, it is a great way to start like AOC said. Having said that, I probably wouldn't be convinced without a lot more cohesiveness and information added if I were a politician, but I do feel in the future it will pass once it is developed enough. We're reaching a point in time where we can't deny anymore the changes that are ensuing from human activity. Pretty soon we'll have to address the consequences of failing to make a change and therefore, I'm sure we'll reach a more technical version of the Green New Deal in the future that appeals to all groups.

I enjoy this week's video because it looks at the climate problem from a different perspective. When we decide to take (or not to take) individual actions to protect the environment and save the planet, we should not just think of them as altruistic actions. "Today I am gonna ride my bike and go vegan because I am feeling like helping the environment!"  Similarly, it makes me think of the "meatless Monday" mentioned in one of the previous videos (I think it's Cowspiracy), which was criticized by an environmentalist who pointed out that being an environmentalist shouldn't just a temporary thing or one or two days in a week. Instead of thinking how much contribution we'll make by choosing not to fly, not to eat meat, not to drive a car, we should think about how much social and climate injustice we add on to the people in the developed world. This is not about altruism. This about making up for the mistakes, unfairness, and injustice we've done in order to become a wealthy country. This is about telling other developing countries to not follow the same path, otherwise, the consequences would be irreversible. 
             <br><br>


I read something in a book the other day which mentions a behavior people do to reduce their pain is to look at others who suffer more. The author tells people that we shouldn't rank the pain because pain is not a competition. I agree with that initially, but then I watched this video. Then I feel it really makes sense why there are "first world problems" and "third-world problems." When they are thousands of people in Bangladesh who often have no access to food, people in this country are thinking about buying a second car. Though we all have our own problems, I think at this point, by comparing, our actions can be less selfish and ego-centric. Besides the green new deal, I really like the Marshall Plan for the earth mentioned in another Ken's video. Helping should be our goal as earth's citizens rather than consuming. No one should be born to suffer. Period.

Before I read the “Green New Deal”, I just assumed that it is about climate change. However, it was a little surprising for me to learn how much socioeconomic issues that it covers. There are a lot of sections where it advocates for equality. For example, it says that the Federal Government is responsible for creating a Green New Deal to “promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth.” It has listed basically all the minorities that are disadvantaged in a socioeconomic way. I acknowledge that it is glad to see how the Green New Deal lays out those human rights issues, though I don’t know how feasible it is for the government to speak for and actually take actions for the past, present, as well as future for those groups. 

             <br><br>

Also, in the end, some goals and projects required for the Green New Deal are mentioned, including the one for “providing all people of the US with high-quality healthcare; affordable, safe, and adequate housing; economic security; and clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and access to nature.” Those projects are very comprehensive and thus expensive. It almost seems like an utopia. Personally, I think we should establish some relatively small goals and strive to achieve them step by step, rather than having such a giant project that changes almost every aspect of our society.

Hi there I totally agree with your comment! I was in a similar situation when I first read the Green New Deal because I did not anticipate that climate change can overlap and associate with social injustices and inequalities. Again, this shows how much I still do not know about the climate crisis. The climate crisis is an environmental issue that affects all lives on the planet and all countries in the world; however, the only slight difference here is how early those countries will get hit by climate change and how hard they will get hit and the degree of the devastation of the aftermath and consequences of climate change. Here is where social inequality and injustice come into play: the poor developing third-world countries despite not being responsible for emitting much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are subjected to the earliest and, in a form, more devastating impacts of climate change and have no financial resources or technology to protect their people and territories from the effects of climate change. On the other hand, the wealthy developed first-world countries are ironically subjected to later impacts of climate change and they are better equipped in terms of the financial resources and technology to protect their lands and people from the harms of the changing climate. This is an unfair and ironic situation, but unfortunately, that is just the way our modern world functions: if a country has more power and influence, then it can do a lot more things than it does not necessarily have to be responsible for, such as the wealthy countries guilty of emitting a far greater amount of carbon emission into the atmosphere and contributing more to the climate crisis and are yet subjected to later and lesser impacts of climate change compared to the poor developing third world countries that play a significantly smaller role in causing the climate crisis.

After reading "The Green New Deal", I felt ashamed and sick that the best stance our government has taken surmounts to "Hey! We should probably do something about that whole climate change thing. Oh and economic inequality! Oh and racism!". Sure, it's great to see that our politicians are waking up to the danger looming over us, but at what point do we move on from "Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal.." to actually creating one? The document seems to be the figurative doggy treat a burglar gives a dog when he's breaking into a house. All it does is act as something to keep environmentalists busy and satisfied. 
             <br><br>

Furthermore, the document seems to be confused in what it wants to tackle. The inclusion of fighting the gender pay gap, racial wealth inequality, and wage stagnation muddies down the most important parts of the document and causes more tension than it needed to. These issues are all closely related to the ideals of a modern day liberal or progressive, which further alienates people who lean right and plays into the hand of those who wish to frame climate change as a push by a radical-left agenda. I don't think that the issues I listed before are unimportant, and I acknowledge that they can be connected to environmental injustice. However, these all seem to be trivial when compared to something as devastating as the Climate Crisis. 
             <br><br>

Another worry of mine after the reading "The Green New Deal" is how easily the United States could masquerade climate change activism as gentrification. It's important that we help developed and developing countries by providing technologies and infrastructure, but this could easily evolve into a situation in which we (accidentally or intentionally) begin to push western culture onto them. Just food for thought.

After reading "The Green New Deal" and watching this video, I believe there is lots of hope to take action and save our planet from catastrophic events, but it is devastating that we have to even create proposals like this because of the actions of billions of selfish humans.  The article gives us clear causes and effects and gives suggestions as to what we humans must do to save our planet. The section that scared me the most was when it stated what can happen if we get to the 2 degrees celsius in temperature rise. Temperature rise can cause mass migration due to the unlivable conditions in certain environments. This is worrisome because our world is already overpopulated. Lets say, for example, Los Angeles. LA's streets are crowded with cars parked at every corner and traffic is horrendous. I can't imagine what it'll be like if another million or so people start migrating to these areas. It will cause major social conflict which won't help us at all. As if it wasn't enough, temperature rise will cause fires to burn twice as long. This will certainly kill thousands of humans as it will get harder and harder to put fires out quickly. I hope these proposals go into effect soon before its too late and damage is irreversible. It is necessary for all of us to act immediately and work to alleviate the climate crisis.

In the reading “the Green New Deal”, it is clear that people start to realize the disastrous negative effects climate change brings to us. And they are acting to reduce carbon emission as much as possible. However, we can see from the Green New Deal is still at the stage of informing the Congress the negative effects on the US. They do give suggestions on solutions, but only theoretically. They said politicians should focus on climate refugees, but they did not mention how. They said people earn low wages should receive subsidy, but there is no exact number occurred. This shows another problem that occurred. That is, we are not taking our effort. That is to say, we are still not paying our full attention to it. However, from my point of view, this should be the number one focus right now as climate change is getting serious day after day. The third problem is that the Green New Deal only focus on the people in the US. They are not considering helping people in less developed countries, such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, which are the countries where supply our goods for fast fashion, for example, and the countries that suffer from both capitalism and climate change the most.

Comparing the overconsumption and other differences between the US and Bangladesh left me pretty shocked. After Ken put it in perspective for me, I didn't realize how much more us Americans waste compared to other countries around the world. While the House of Reps explain to us how we can start taking action, I know it won't help much. Although they lay down the facts and how we can, as a whole, work towards resolving the issue around the climate crisis, I know many people still won't cooperate or be compliant to these new ways. Those who truly believe we can work through these issues while still growing economically sound plain out ridiculous. 
             <br><br>

I feel bad for the individuals in Bangladesh being negatively affected by the US' actions. Our manufacturing companies are not only affecting the workers, but their environments and homes as well. Every single day, Bangladesh and other Third World Countries are being targeted every single day. People within the media use their platforms to help gain aid for these countries but most don't even contribute anything themselves. Politicians as well have been known for saying something that would help the economy in order to gain the people's votes but will later turn their head when the issue is brought up. All I'm saying is, people can be a lot of talk and won't necessarily back up their words with their actions.

After reading the “Green New Deal,” I felt extremely hopeful and happy that politicians are actually acknowledging a radical resolution to the climate change crisis. I realized that social injustice has plenty to do with climate change because the environment and climate injustice are both related due to a country's superiority and economy. Poor developing third world countries, such as Bangladesh, have absolutely no stable support for financial resources in order to help them deal with their vulnerability on lack of reliable and quality infrastructures. Bangladesh and other third-world countries are dealing with the effects of climate 10x stronger due to lack of funds. They are dealing with extreme Co2 pollution and rapid weather and sea level rises mainly due to factories owned by the U.S. This is quite saddening because countries like Bangladesh are the ones contributing the least amount of carbon emission into the atmosphere and the United States is just watching as they continue to create and destroy. The United States is not worried because these activities are not directly harming us as we have the money to help create temporary solutions for these problems. It is extremely unfair to see how our harmful actions are affecting other countries' health and environments. 
             <br><br>

The factual data in this article is shocking as Americans consume 265 pounds of meat a year while Bangladeshis consume only 4 pounds of meat a year as 40 million individuals are starving. Also, 4 in 1000 people own a car in Bangladesh while 800 in 1000 own a car in the U.S. This is EXACT proof that we are causing the majority of environmental damage as we are contributing about 20% of carbon emission. 
             <br><br>

The “Green New Deal '' addresses these vulnerable communities and prompts direct action towards investing more money and resources into these countries in order to create better infrastructures. The United States is a wealthy first world country who has the capability to first handedly take on a leadership role and make vital changes related to climate change. This type of political activism could be revolutionary as it has the potential to have a great impact on economic decisions and social factors contributing to climate crisis.

Hey Savana, just wanted to say that I also felt extremely hopefully just know that there are actually politicians out there acknowledging the climate crisis and not just ignoring it for money from oil companies, unlike many other politicians in high government positions. And not only are they acknowledging the problem, but they’re making plans to resolve the problem. I agree with your realization that social injustice plays a big role in the climate crisis, because of how environmental and climate injustice are related to a country’s superiority and economy. What’s sad is that developed countries, such as the United States can withstand the catastrophic impacts of climate change, such as wildfires. In contrast to this, many third-world countries don’t have the resources to combat such an event. As  you said, “Bangladesh and other third-world countries are dealing with the effects of climate 10x stronger due to lack of funds.”. Bangladesh and other third-world countries are having to deal with the climate disasters that are mainly due to the United States and other developed countries that don’t use their energy and resources sustainably. I agree with your claim that it’s quite saddening that third-world countries, such as Bangladesh are contributing the least to climate change, yet are getting hit the hardest by its detrimental effects. Like you said, it’s extremely unfair for the countries that contributed little to nothing to the climate crisis. 
             <br><br>
I was shocked when I heard that people in Bangladesh eat about only 4 pounds of meat a year, compared to the average American who consumes about 265 pounds of meat a year. Tp put that into perspective, that’s 6600% more than Bangladesh meat consumption, which proves that we are a big problem in the climate crisis. It’s crazy how us Americans are living lavishly, prosperous lives, while 40 million individuals in Bangladesh are starving. 40% of the country falls under 3 categories: hunger, starvation, and chronic hunger. We don’t have that problem in the U.S., because we have the resources to withstand these problems, unlike Bangladesh, which is struggling to survive off what it has.
<br><Hr>
I agree that it is terrible the disproportionate amount that the United States contributes to greenhouse gas emissions compared to countries like Bangladesh, when the impacts are felt the most in those countries that contribute the least. It is inspiring to see people trying to pass policy like this with such an emphasis on making amends to communities which suffer due to circumstances outside of their control. Although I knew we were the leading country in meat consumption per capita,  I had no idea that the amount of meat consumed was quite so uneven in the US compared to other countries. It really makes me think about how some people claim that they cannot survive on a meatless diet, while millions prove that such a thing is possible every day. I think the Green New Deal receives a lot of criticism for setting "unrealistic expectations" with regard to providing aid to oppressed communities and making lasting change in the systems. But it is only unrealistic if we all agree that it won't happen. We as a nation have the capital to aid to frontline communities, we just need to decide that the time has come to use it that way.

<br><Hr>
I really like the way that you used the words “acknowledge” rather than the words “fix” the climate change problems that are currently present within the world. I do admire AOC for presenting such a controversial piece of legislation that brings to light the climate change problems. I think what it helps is to just create more awareness about climate change and make sure that our legislators truly understand what is at stake. Every resolution needs to acknowledge what is currently happening, and I think that the idea of creating a Green New Deal is essential to the furthering of climate change in the United States. AOC, the youngest representative in the House, is truly an admirable figure. She holds a strong passion for a new direction of politics and really improves the political atmosphere by asking the questions that are important. When she presented the Green New Deal back in 2019, the FDR-inspired bill set the parties into a heated debate. Now, the Green New Deal is being presented by Democratic primary candidates, especially Bernie Sanders, who has been endorsed by AOC. 
             <br><br>


However, as I do approve of a Green new Deal, I think that the main flaw lies not in the purpose, but of the execution. If you look closely at the affirmations and operative clauses, they really show the goals that they want to meet and emphasize the standards and procedures that need to be in place in order to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The Green New Deal brings up the numbers that need to be met, how much we need to reduce, and the different solutions that need to be initiated. However, it does not state the logistical aspect of how we can combat climate change. We stray away from a lot of what we need to do by what we should do. There is a lot of policy that is being implemented, but there is not a lot of tangible solutions with real implementation mechanisms that can really integrate these policies into our everyday society. 

             <br><br>

A large part of why Bernie does so well, especially with women, the gay community, and voters under 45 is because his policies appeal to that demographic. But, to some, that is exactly what he is preaching: policies. Yet, as with AOC, there is not necessarily a viable mechanism in which he can implement these policies. Republicans find his solutions absolutely disgusting, and the idea of creating such extreme changes to the American government is nearly impossible. I am not saying that it can be done, but I am saying that it is unlikely due to the severity of what he delivers to promise. I think AOC and Bernie are similar in that regard. I do hope that someday, their policies can be accomplished, but, I often am conflicted between policies and probability. In order to get the Green New Deal done, there needs to be a change in establishment, not just executive administration.

Before this assignment, I knew of the Green New Deal but never really looked into it and read it before. This proposal brought up not only the issue of greenhouse gas emissions but also those of economic inequality and racial injustice.
             <br><br>

I agree with what the bill proposes even if it seems too idealistic, it is at least reflecting all that needs to be done. I liked the opening statistics that showed the effects of global warming above 2 degrees Celsius can have on our environment. It establishes a sense of urgency that needs to be taken care of. I admire the political action on the climate crisis because we need to do something now instead of waiting around trying to convince people to change their point of view. If we look around, changes are happening now and it's only expected to get worse. We don’t have a lot of time and need to act now.

I’m also on the same page as Veronica. Before this week’s reading assignment, I had no idea of what the Green New Deal is. The closest I’ve experienced anything similar to it is during high school and climate change organizations would come present in my classrooms on how we as a community were being affected disproportionately by factory & highway structures surrounding us. This sense of environmental racism only further pushes how even more quickly and devastating a 2 degree Celsius increase will affect those who have less fortunate backgrounds. While the Green New Deal is a step in the right way, it needs to be brought to the attention of the greater public in order for it to be effective.

Reading the “Green New Deal'' I was shook up by the fact that the temperature needs to be kept below 1.4 degrees C. That requires the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. I read that and I’m like “pfft okay.” Ken states that 1/10 people suffer from chronic hunger and in America, we struggle with obesity, and it just makes me feel like we’re too selfish to do anything about the problem. In my eyes, America is the best equipped to handle changes necessary. It would almost fit into that heroic American identity to be the country that leads the way in saving the planet, but we fail to rise to the occasion. The U.S. is responsible for 20% of global emissions, so it's only fitting we take the initiative to do something about it. This plan comes at a large cost as many people will lose their jobs and will be forced to deal with change, but what’s the alternative? The infrastructure needed to make the plan a reality will create jobs and prevent the usual capitalistic control companies have over projects like that. It’s just a shame that the people with power in this country don’t see this as a realistic option. They’re motivated by money but don’t realize that if we don’t do what necessary the quality of life of everyone is going to be affected. Economic stress, famine, and migration are going to cause all types of conflict and politicians don’t seem to recognize. Reading the Green New Deal it fills my mind with hope of what the world could look like. It changes focus from what’s best for us economically to what’s best for the people around the world. I just wish our government wasn’t so motivated by money and had the foresight to see what's in store. We can continue to ignore the climate crisis, but sooner or later we’ll have to deal with the reality of what we have done to the environment. It’s going to be horrific.

I think it’s crazy how many of our problems root from having too much of something while other developing countries don’t have enough. Hiltner’s example of the Thomas Fire was very eye opening because we are living a luxurious life where we are better equipped to deal with anthropogenic climate change impacts, which poorer countries have to sacrifice their own local environment in exchange for development. The outcome of climate change seems so scary to us, but it must be even more fearful for poorer countries who do not have similar resources and will probably get the shorter end of the stick. Therefore, I do believe that it is our responsibility to mitigate cultural problems, develop strong environmental laws, and help underdeveloped countries. Since we are the source of their problem, we should be the one who helps them due to our CO2/GHG emissions and consumerism culture. In my prior global warming course, we learned about the Green New Deal, and as I expressed last quarter, I’m glad there is a legal federal document that somewhat makes it seem like our government even cares. Climate change is a global issue, and as proclaimed leaders of the world, we should take on this global issue through leading by example.

After reading the original copy of the Green New Deal, I was surprised at how some people think it is the most radical proposition. It seems reasonable, necessary, and straightforward to me. Humans have caused climate change which will wreak havoc on our lives as we know it with extreme weather and environmental conditions. To me, the Green New Deal seemed to highlight basic human rights, such as providing people with “high-quality health care; affordable, safe, and adequate housing; economic security; and clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and access to nature.”
             <br><br>

We need to, as Ken says, “Raise the quality of life,” of developing countries, without raising greenhouse gas emissions. Also, Ken explains,“One in ten people across the globe experience chronic hunger, daily.” This really makes me wonder what is wrong with the human race that we won’t help fellow people, even though we have so much excess food. In Bangladesh, 40 million people are starving. In the United States, 40 percent of people are overweight. This is crazy. This is so incredibly unjust. Additionally, I was shocked to hear that in Bangladesh, 4 in 1000 people own a car, versus in the United States where 838 out of 1000 have a car. The social differences are enormous. 
             <br><br>

Overall, there are both social and environmental justice problems running rampant across the globe. Being the emitter of one fourth of emissions in the climate crisis, the United States owes so much effort, time, and money into putting a stop to it. I feel so sorry for places like Bangladesh who have experienced such disastrous events, like the Dhaka garment factory collapse, because of the United States greed and need for continuous growth. We must stop these social injustices, because we have the power to do so. We should do everything we can to help countries like Bangladesh, but not overpower them. We have done enough damage. Also, we need to help Bangladesh when they experience catastrophic events from climate change, because we were a huge cause of it. We owe to them to at least help repair what we caused. I believe this can be done through asking what they would like help with, and completing or helping with those tasks. In my opinion, if they need financial help, we should give them money because we are what caused so much of the environmental change that has and will continue to wreak havoc on them.

Alexandria Ortez-cortez’s resolution calling for a “Green New Deal” makes some incredibly strong points and is very comprehensive. She begins by referencing the IPCC’s climate report, and naming some of the most devastating effects we can anticipate as a result of anthropogenic climate change. She clearly points out, as did the IPCC, that we have to remain under our 2 degree C goal. 
             <br><br>
One thing I really appreciated about the resolution was its focus on framing Climate Change as not just an environmental issue but an issue of social justice. I think this makes it more persuasive, especially within Washington.
             <br><br>
AOC also clearly lays out dozens of actions our country should take in order to achieve these goals. And the resolution cleverly, recognizes that the implementation of these policies will put people out of work, therefore appropriate steps must be taken to assist these laborers in finding new, more sustainable work.

Exactly, this article showed us the overall picture of what caused the climate issue and what we can do to solve them.  I think it is also partly related to climate justice and climate scandals. We already talked about these problems for 7 weeks, but how can we solve it and why is issues like climate justice is happening is what we should think about at this moment.

I feel like “The Green New Deal” was very straight-forward and pretty much just said what we are going to face in the future and exactly what we need to do. The reading stated that climate change is a direct effect from human activity, causing sea level rise, more wildfires, more severe storms and droughts. This reading also said that if global warming rises above 2 degrees Celsius there will be more mass migrations, the economy will worsen, wildfires will be more threatening, and 99% of reefs will be gone. In the YouTube video, Ken brings up an interesting question when he says,”Should we help Bangladesh since we are the ones who put most of the CO2 into the atmosphere?” and my answer is yes. Even if it wasn’t us who put most of the CO2 there, we are a very wealthy country and have the extra resources to help struggling countries around the world, so we could help them in any way possible.

I completely agree with the points you have made. The Green New Deal reading stated the path we are currently taking if we continue with the damage, but it also gave solutions to these problems. Plus, it focuses on the role the United States has played in the climate crisis (which I feel like most readings fail to do) as the developed countries are the ones emitting the most greenhouse gases through the process of burning fossil fuels. Even though we are the ones emitting the most carbon dioxide for our personal gain, the developing countries are having to suffer the consequences a lot more than we are. Therefore, answering Ken's question, it's only right for the developed countries to put the money they earned from burning fossil fuels, towards helping the developing countries fight back the climate crisis.

I too found the reading to be quite straight forward. The Green New Deal Reading was straight to the point in listing the many affects the climate has undergone because of human activity, not only does it list a number of problems which will and are already currently affecting every aspect of our life, it directly makes goals as to try and counter-act or help the problem. While a lot of us are already very aware of why so many of these issues tie back to the overall problem of climate change, I do have to admit that a skeptic or someone uneducated on this topic may not necessarily see the correlation between some of the solutions proposed and that of the effect on our planet. Kathleen. I’m also glad you make it a point to repeat the line on the rising of 2 degrees celsius as the report states this could lead to a major loss of annual economic output in the US (and of course have several negative economic effects on the rest of the world) and also mentioned the huge amount of people capable of being exposed to deadly heat stress. These are key issues to take into consideration and make people aware of because as of now we’re only really getting closer to facing these problems. I also agree with your comment on Ken’s question. Regardless on where we fall on the list of CO2 emitters, we should uphold our country to the responsibility of helping out other countries who can do better but do not have the same amount or quality of resources. It’s upsetting that people don’t see a bigger picture in which helping another country is not an economic loss but a win for the planet we share.

Prior to actually reading the finer details of the Green New Deal, all I have come to see from online criticism are these memes attacking on AoC and the Green New Deal, referring to it stating “that we would have to tear down all the buildings in the United States and replace them”, the Green Deal is all about cow farts and the “End of All Air Travel”. It even got to the point where it was covered by multiple media sources over the world from BBC, NBC and the NYTimes (also we already know Fox would have covered this topic), and the problem grew outwards to the public. Even before I took both of Hiltner’s classes, I questioned  how cow farts add on to the climate change in anyway, well my curiosity was question was answered. 
             <br><br>
But after actually reading the Green New Deal in its fullest continuity, these ideas of destroying all the old buildings, it being all about cow farts and the end of air travel as we all know it didn’t appear at all and stemmed out as being overly exaggerated statements created by those who simply opposed the Green New Deal and wanted to taint its greater message. Even after reading it, I questioned how they even got these ideas at all because of the fact that the Green New Deal is a very clear and easy to understand reading that a person of any quality could understand to the simplest degree, yet they still find a way to taint its image. To me it’s as if a critic claimed Dr. Seuss being an anarchist because of the actions and chaos that go on in the Cat in the Hat between Thing 1 and Thing 2. 
             <br><br>
But I digress from the hate side that occurs against the Green New Deal, and say that what is proposed here is a great step in the right direction for the United States to stand as a major leading figure for a more green future of humankind as even AoC even refers to this in the deal. A lot of what is proposed are the many things we have gone over this year in English 23 from Cowspiracy to Before the Flood and is everything we need to improve our nation and the world for the generations of tomorrow. Where I agree most with the Green New Deal is how it will open more jobs for Americans in need of work because of the fact that new solar farms would need maintenance, new infrastructure jobs, and new transportation jobs on the high speed rail systems that would help speed up the nations travelling issue.  How would this cripple the nation's economy as many critics online claim? Upgrading homes and building to be more sustainable (Not destroying them), forging more sustainable farming practices (reducing the emissions of methane) and promotion of technology around the world would better benefit the planet than many would like to disagree with, no matter your political view.

I agree with the people who say the Green New Deal (GND) is impossible to implement. However, that does not mean I think the GND doesn't serve a purpose. The GND is not a bill, it is more of a framework or template on how the climate crisis can be addressed. The ideas in the GND are useful for starting a discourse on the issue and inspiring local and state governments to develop their own GND's. For example, LA, New York City, Maine, and Seattle have all either drafted or begun to implement their own GND's. It should also be noted that the transition to renewables will not be carbon neutral or cruelty free by any means. Turbines, photovoltaic cells, and other renewable technologies require mass amounts of rare earth minerals to be constructed. The mining and transport of these materials is destructive and carbon intensive. That is not to say we shouldn't invest in renewables, but we should be realistic about these things.

After reading the Green New Deal, I realized how much of an effort people are going to put into the betterment of the environment. I noted that the document was very easy to read, precise, clear, and inclusive of all ethnicities. I really could not have thought of a way in which people could misinterpret it. The premises were inclusive and considerate of the lives of people who may be affected by the new changes. I appreciated how the document was considerate of those who might be financially unstable once the oil and gas industry disappears. People who work for these companies may not all be money hungry and bad. Some people work just for the sake of working and providing for their own families. Therefore, with the Green New Deal, I am appreciative of its consideration of the jobs that will be lost once the oil and gas industry is eliminated. Having a plan and a promise to those who will lose their jobs as a result of the Green New Deal makes it not only desirable, but also tangible for the people of America. I. believe that it is a well crafted document that is considerate and inclusive of people in the oil and gas industry who may want to help the planet, but also are trying to feed themselves and their families at the same time.

While reading Resolution #109, I actually started to have some hope that maybe our government would finally start doing something productive for our country, which is something I have yet to see in my lifetime, unfortunately. But when I finished reading, I realized that this resolution would not likely lead to any effective legislation and would likely just be used as talking points for members of Congress during their next re-election campaign. While I wish that weren't true, I've found it hard to build any level of confidence in our elected and appointed government officials, especially during, but not limited to, the current administration. While I realize this resolution is the first step to getting some actual change, I'm reluctant to get my hopes up until I see that change starting to happen.

uuuhhh we are doing productive things all the time what do you mean?  i agree that i don't have any confidence in the current administration , but that does not mean that we are not productive as a country. climate injustices are occurring all over the world, and social justice in inexplicably linked with climate justice. We are lucky to live in this country on one hand, but on the other hand extremely unlucky to live here and have very little say in our country's impact on the planet. the GND are just ideas not any laws to put into place... but without these ideas, they will never get implemented.

After reading the Green New Deal, it brought a little relief to see that at least some members of our government see the issue and are working to confront it. However, while the Green New Deal seems like our government is working to do something, I feel that it’s an unrealistic approach to a big issue. 
              <br><br>
In the document, the big scary facts are brought forth, such as the massive losses to future economic output, the death of 99% of all coral reefs, and the millions of people who could be subject to deadly heat stress, just to name a few. However, when you go down to read upon the potential solutions to the issue, I feel like there wasn’t really any promising ones. All I kept seeing was the things we wanted to see happen, like invest in zero-emissions technology and transportation, but no plan on how that can be achieved. I also feel that the Green New Deal primarily focuses on objective matters to solve the climate crisis, while neglecting the cultural aspects that contribute to it as well. However, it is still a work in progress, and hopefully more politicians get on board with the deal so a more organized attack plan can be formulated.

I was taking an environmental science class last year when the Green New Deal was presented and our TA had us read it for our section discussion. I remember reading it and thinking it was very ambitious but it would be impressive and great for the environment if these policies were implemented. When we had our discussion, I was so surprised by the number of people that were negative towards the plan promoted by AOC. Many students, including the TA, said it was impractical and too radical that it would never be implemented. Now that I have learned about the cost of environmental disasters, I found it interesting that a lot of people complained about how it would increase income tax and would cost Americans billions of dollars. In the documentary, Fire in Paradise we learned it was the most expensive natural disaster in 2018 and cost 16.5 billion US dollars. That was just one disaster among the hundreds of others that occurred, those amounts will add up. People need to realize it is worth it to invest in our future and pay up now rather than sacrificing more later when it will not just be money but also our families and homes.
              <br><br>

One thing that surprised me this time reading it was the socio-economic issue and injustices it addresses regarding women, low-income workers and other vulnerable members of society. This ties back to what Prof. Hiltner's video lecture said about the environmental injustices. The US puts 25% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere but can not be bothered to do anything about it because we are not feeling the full effects. Whereas, the 30 million people in Bangladesh do not have that luxury of being able to pay their way out of these environmental disasters and are suffering the full extent of the crisis. This Green New Deal resolution gives our generation hope because we know there are people in Congress now that represent our beliefs and are advocating for things like net-zero global emissions by 2050.

I agree with you that environmental issues cause socio-economic issues and injustices, but I think the article has exaggerated the impact of environmental issues on them. Socio-economic issues have always existed in this society. Even if there is no environmental crisis, there will still be serious gaps between the rich and the poor, such as in the 1990s. But I agree with the article that global warming has led to more frequent natural disasters. Whether it is from the videos and movies that Ken showed us before, or from my own personal experience, I can appreciate it. Therefore, environmental issues remain a cause for concern. I think the improvement methods proposed in the article are also feasible, such as encouraging agricultural families. I think there is already a trend from urban to rural, and this has appeared around me, and I also believe that it will become more and more frequent in the future.

The video about climate justice was so interesting because it’s a perspective that doesn’t get very much focus. The developed nations in the world are the one who are contributing the most to climate change, but underdeveloped nations are the ones who experience most of the consequences. I really liked that Ken brought up the idea of “degrowth” because that is a way I had never really thought about climate action before, but it is very true. In order to make our planet sustainable and habitable for all who live on it, the developed world must decrease its emissions and resource use, while less developed countries must find a way to increase their developments (in a sustainable manner) in order to increase their quality of life. It was especially frustrating to hear about all the things Americans are doing to the environment through the everyday actions of eating meat, regularly using air travel, and owning/driving cars, all while other countries pay the price for our actions. Climate justice is so important because many marginalized groups in developed nations, and people from less developed nations, have fewer resources in their communities to combat the same issues that other people can take care of easily. Ken made this especially clear when he was talking about the Thomas Fires and how Santa Barbara, a wealthy area in a wealthy country, had the resources necessary to combat this natural disaster while many people, if faced with this scenario, wouldn’t have been able to do the same. The only way to have any sort of success in managing climate change is if everyone works together to understand and lessen their own impact, and then, person by person, nation by nation, we can make progress.

Throughout this class, we have continually seen this pattern of the consequences of the US’ actions on our planet such as the comparison of food eaten/wasted in the US versus Bangladesh--and yet they suffer significantly more. At this point, the numbers no longer come as a surprise to me, which I can’t tell is more alarming or more saddening. However, I am glad that we are seeing an approach that actually sounds hopeful and positive in light of all this disheartening reality. The ideas that the Green New Deal proposes like high-speed rail and public transits sound positive, but I do have to wonder at the same time how much do these help countries like Bangladesh who are greatly suffering from our emissions? However, the Green New Deal does undoubtedly have strategic implementations that consist of the steps in the right direction in tackling the climate crisis. The question that remains is if we will be proactive and follow through with all these “solutions.”  The US  government is responsible of actually implementing a deal like this one, after all, none of this does no one any good if we can’t actually gather the initiative to push for it.

Hey Chloe! I agree that many of the proposals made by the Green New Deal, such as the the expansion of renewable power sources and cleaner, more efficient transportation systems, will undoubtedly help the U.S. to reduce it's own emissions, but also find it hard not to think about all of the countries that this plan will not help, such as Bangladesh and many others. As Ken mentioned, in the developing world the challenge of energy use will not be how to use LESS energy, but rather how to use more energy in a sustainable way for the future health of the planet. To me, it seems that without more specific support from the U.S. towards this goal, many of these developing countries will simply fall into using dirty fossil fuels as they industrialize, and thus will produce major emissions that may actually end up negating any gains made by the U.S. through a plan such as the Green New Deal. In my opinion, we need a climate bill that has all of the domestic changes of the Green New Deal, with additional proposals to give aid and support to developing countries who will soon industrialize. Whether this comes through economic aid for clean energy infrastructure, or simply guidance on the creation of an efficient transportation system, I believe that the foreign aspect of a climate bill may actually be more important than the changes made domestically by us in the U.S.

              <br><br>

Additionally,  I too have little faith in the U.S. being able to implement a plan like the Green New Deal anytime soon. While a majority of  those in the younger generations see a plan like the Green New Deal as a necessary step to ensure the future of our planet and species, I think that unfortunately too many older people still see a climate bill as a needless shift that will only serve to "hurt" our economy and bring unwanted change to our way of life.

At first glance I found the format of The Green New Deal very difficult to understand. My eyes skipped over the bullet points and format and glazed past the formal jargon. But once I took a second and actually tried to read it I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to understand. I was additionally surprised by how much contention it has caused. The  main complaint I hear when people discuss this plan is that it’s unorganized or illogical. But the first thing that struck me while reading is just how carefully thought out the document is. It starts out with a declaration of facts followed by the possible cause and effects of climate change. It then addresses our systematic injustice and who will suffer under climate devastation. Then it clearly promotes the goals of the green new deal and outlines how the government will adapt and what jobs will be provided. To me it seems like the opposite of hasty or illogical. It offers a no nonsense, stark picture of how America will adapt to climate change in a way that addresses our economy and job market. An argument I have heard about this proposition is that it does not offer enough concrete details. “These goals are all well and good but it doesn’t explain how it will work.” Well… yeah? It’s an outline. This isn’t the end? This Green New Deal document wouldn’t be the end. It is supposed to guide future desicions and be the start of change not completely overturn the system overnight. I believe the only mistake the document makes is in the crazy idea that everyone in the house was on even footing. They underestimated their colleagues’ greed and denial. The plan outlined here to me looks like a utopia. It looks like a Disneyland type ideal of Tomorrowland full of jobs driven by the science and civil sector; and a world that is green and clean. It’s crazy to me that in a society where every Sci-fi movie outlines an apocalyptic wasteland as our future politicians would be so worried about a clean one. Clean public transit, high speed rail,  new jobs, enhancing biodiversity, upgrading US Infastructure; these all sound like non-partisan issues! Anyone on earth can run on fixing infastructure and public transportation. Any Republican or Democrat could win a ticket based on providing new jobs to a dying job market and increasing US based production (green factories and tech). But as soon as you put “green” or “fossil fuel free” in front of any of these suddenly its a liberal agenda. It is ridiculous to me how small changes to make the lives of regular people better, OUTSIDE of stopping climate change, could be opposed by any politician. It makes no sense to me.

We don’t think about how wide of an impact our actions can have. And it can be hard to modify our lives even after we hear about the devastations we are contributing to elsewhere. If it isn’t immediately and directly impacting us, even I am guilty of not changing my own habits. It’s not that I don’t lack compassion or the passion to help those struggling, but for some reason we get so wrapped up in our own lives that it can be hard not to be selfish and keep within our routine. It is crazy to hear about how lucky we are to reside in a country of wealth. I did not realize the immense benefits here compared to developing countries. It’s so ironic that we are one of the top emitters of carbon dioxide and a major reason the climate crisis exists, but we obtained immense wealth from this and can use it to fight against most of the consequences. Whereas developing countries barely contribute to the crisis and will have so little means to fight against it because of their extreme poverty. We also have, for the most part, jobs with fair wages and at least somewhat of a choice for what we’d like to do. People in impoverished nations are often forced to take a job with horrendous conditions and extremely low wages. We also have the choice to not participate in environmentally disastrous careers, but their options are often factories that directly pollute the local environment. Ken gave us so many shocking statistics in this video but one that stuck out to me was the fact that we have a 40 percent obesity rate in the United States while 40% of Bangladesh is either suffering from hunger, starvation or chronic hunger. 
              <br><br>

I think we have a huge responsibility to these other nations. We should help solve both the social and climate injustices in these areas. Higher wages and proper working conditions should be mandatory. This in turn should almost eliminate the environmentally toxic fast fashion industry. Climate regulations could also eliminate some of the poor environmental effects.

The Green New Deal is an incredibly controversial document. Many sing its praises, saying it will usher in a new era of environmental responsibility, however, many others are not as enthused. 
              <br><br>


The argument that the Green New Deal will collapse the economy symbolizes not only the lack of agreement on the climate crisis occurring, but also of the blatant ignorance of those who will suffer the most from our current actions. The entire premise of the GND is to balance American life with these so-called ‘drastic’ changes that must occur in order to further ensure global health and safety. All of this while concurrently developing industry to work on tackling issues of concern; I know many people who dislike the ideas posed in this document are concerned about being put out of work for the sake of bettering the environment, however this, as well as many common subjects of complaint, are directly addressed. Universal access to food, water, a sustainable environment, good jobs with safety requirements - and all of that with zero net carbon emissions.

              <br><br>

It’s perhaps fair to call the Green New Deal idealistic, but that doesn’t mean it’s lost any of its validity or security in the statements it makes. It is entirely possible for the United States to acclimate to our changing world as we’ve made it so, it’s simply a matter of bureaucrats taking a step out from behind the desk and realizing they have to do something to address whatever the hell is awaiting us.

I found this week’s reading really interesting. Reading the Green New Deal kind of put a lot of things into perspective, especially since most of the resolutions that are being proposed are mainly what Ken has been discussing about since the quarter. From the beginning of the article, it has already stated that climate change is manmade and is contributing to a lot of the crisis that the U.S. is facing today more frequently. From severe weather changes to declining life expectancy, these are issues that so many people are being influenced to believe that it is not really due to reasons that only big corporations benefit from. The lives of people who are affected the most from these issues are disregarded. From the solutions that are being proposed throughout the entire article, I kept thinking about how it was mainly the basic needs of people that the United States is failing to provide to the millions of people. Adequate housing, livable wages, health care, clean water, clean air, energy, etc, these are things that everyone should have. The Green New Deal summarizes all of the great solutions that need to be implemented immediately if we want the preserve the state of our planet. It emphasizes how critical the U.S.’s role is in combating climate change. The question now is how will the U.S. step up to create global change that we impact billions of lives?

I completely agree with you that the US will have to step up in reducing climate change in order for the rest of the world to also step up. I find it interesting that the green new deal hits on both the problems in the US when it comes to the inequality of people of color or the homeless and the problems around the world such as in Bangladesh where so many people are struggling greatly. The question that I kept asking myself while watching the movie is if the US should focus on itself first or continue being the police of the world and attempt to help other countries that are in more need. The Green New Deal seems to say that we need to step up by helping lower-income Americans first and by helping ourselves first we can help other nations. 

              <br><br>

I believe when we actually feel the first effects of climate change it is feasible that we can implement the green new deal and help lower income  Americans.  I don't see a world we will be able to have "Degrowth" in the economy unless we can see the imminent effects. However, I am more worried about how we can help other countries because the US has a history of only going around the world in order to help ourselves. No doubt changing how we approach climate will help other first world countries by showing them a major global can transition,  but I don't think the US will step in in third world countries and help them transition in a more sustainable way of living based on our history of stepping in around the world.

I agree with what Ken is saying in his video, and the first thing that struck me is how we are going to figure out how to raise the quality of life for everyone without harming anyone else. I feel that right now first world countries have raised their own qualities of life, but while doing so negatively affected the quality of life for developing countries.  I think that developing countries, like Ken said, need to focus on drastically reducing emissions while also moving towards renewable energy.  By moving to renewable energy we will be reducing emissions, but more has to be done as well to reduce them to sustainable levels.   It's crazy to me that in Bangladesh the per capita meat consumption is 4 pounds per year while the US is a whopping 265 pounds per year.  That is a huge difference and something that in the US sake, can easily be reduced by simple lifestyle changes, which can also help to fix the current obesity problem that the US has. 

              <br><br>

As for the green new deal, I liked how it laid everything out in an easy to digest manner.  I feel like a lot of things you read about climate change can contain a lot of jargon and be a lot of information to digest at once, but the layout of the green new deal made it easy to comprehend and I felt like you could actually take and keep information from it.

I think the "green new deal" was a great movie which has revealed some true facts about our environmental and climate justice movement. It is heartbreaking that our environment has been so damaged, however, in the movie, I did see people start to take actions and some practical movements in order to make progress. It mentioned that the green new deal helped America out of economic crisis so I really hope it can help people get out of the climate crisis.

The Green New Deal was designed by a large group of people dedicated to fighting the climate climate. A major key point of it is the moving away from fossil fuels and using other forms of energy. Ironically a big critique of it by me and many others is its lack of focus on nuclear power. Nuclear power is not harmful towards the climate and is much more vast yet there is a major stigma that it's not ready and it's too dangerous which is just ridiculous. Fracking is killing our planet expeditiously. A major way to get away from it is nuclear energy. Although it has a major issue the Green New Deal has plenty of ways that show its a step in the right direction. The ones that  I fully enjoy and support are improving all infrastructure to be eco friendly, invest in renewable power sources, and investing in transportation systems that are zero emission. Many of our ways of life are riddled with hazards for the environment and in order to convince others to not use them we need to have feasible replacements. Transportation is a major part of CO2 emission and should be addressed at the federal government. A brand new system that is zero emission will require a lot of money and time but it is what needs to be done. The Green New Deal shows us what is possible and what could be done, the Green New Deal gives us hope for the future.

I like how The Green New Deal mentions a lot of the things we have discussed in class. In the beginning, it lists that human activity is the "dominant" cause and has led to causing extreme weather events. The Green New Deal admits that the United States is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions and that they must take the leading role, but besides improving our own country I believe we should also put effort in helping the other countries who are affected by our significant CO2 emissions. Of course, we might have to start with having a significant amount of improvement in our country before helping the others. Another thing I found important was the realization that there is a need to protect the "vulnerable" communities. The focus on the idea of providing a better way of living for "all people of the United States” and sustaining our economy, seemed quite selfish to me. As Ken mentioned many differences between Bangladesh and the United States, I was very shocked and this made me realize that we should put in the effort to provide them with the social, environmental, and climate justice that we seek for within our own country.

In the reading “the Green New Deal”, it is clear that people start to realize the disastrous negative effects climate change brings to us. And they are acting to reduce carbon emission as much as possible. However, we can see from the Green New Deal is still at the stage of informing the Congress the negative effects on the US. They do give suggestions on solutions, but only theoretically. They said politicians should focus on climate refugees, but they did not mention how. They said people earn low wages should receive subsidy, but there is no exact number occurred. This shows another problem that occurred. That is, we are not taking our effort. That is to say, we are still not paying our full attention to it. However, from my point of view, this should be the number one focus right now as climate change is getting serious day after day. The third problem is that the Green New Deal only focus on the people in the US. They are not considering helping people in less developed countries, such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, which are the countries where supply our goods for fast fashion, for example, and the countries that suffer from both capitalism and climate change the most.

Reading the archive for why it is the duty of the federal government to implement a green new deal gave me a bit more insight into how the climate crisis affects the government. I never considered how things such as storms and hurricanes cause severe damage to the infrastructures of cities that the government has to pay not only to build but replace and repair is upwards of $1,000,000,000,000. 
              <br><br>
One thing that I was overall very confused by was how they have the goal of having “zero-emissions”. As we learned in this class pretty much everything has a carbon footprint so the zero-emission goal seems redundant to me.

I found this weeks reading very interesting.  I liked the fact that the article gave multiple issues that are caused by the United States.  It acknowledged the fact that the United States has caused all these problems.  A few of them were:  human activity is the dominant cause of observed climate change over the past century.  Sea level rise, increase in wildfires, severe storms, droughts, mass migration from the regions most affected by climate change, a loss of 99 percent of all coral reefs on Earth, risk of damage to $1,000,000,000,000 of public infrastructructure and coastal real estate in the U.S.  These are some of the few issues that the United States has been at fault for.  It is our actions that is causing these issues.  I also loved the fact that the article also gave what “opportunities” the New Deal era can bring.  Some of them were:  create millions of good, high wage jobs in the United States, to provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States, to achieve net zero given house gas emmissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers, to create millions of good, high wage jobs and ensure prosperily and economic security for all people of the United States, clean air and water, climate and community resiliency, healthy food, access to nature.  This article actually gives a sense of hope.  A hope that we need, something that we have not been able to feel because it seems as if politicians are simply ignoring the issue, but after reading this article it gives me hope that maybe politicians are actually going to do something now.

With almost every piece of information that Ken presents us with, I either go on to hate myself or hate the United States. This reading encouraged me to hate the United States. In response to Diego, I feel like you may have used the wrong choice of words. You said that you liked the fact that this article presented us with information about all of the U.S’s mistakes… I agree that the article did that, however I was not a fan of that part. I would much rather be left in the dark then be informed of the country’s stupidity. I’m just super naïve. One thing that I do agree with you on is the overall feeling of hope that is ignited through the reading. That was something inspiring to read. 
              <br><br>

When talking about the politicians, I agree that the last few readings/movies have made it difficult to see change coming, but this movie finally made me feel differently. This year is the first year I will be able to vote in the election. I am going to intensely observe the viewpoints of all the candidates to make sure they agree with my views on climate change. I’m excited it is my first year to vote because this way I know I am not responsible for the nut jobs that are currently in office. 
              <br><br>

The New Deal Era does present the United States with a series of opportunities that would benefit the nation; the only contingent factor being who will put these ideas into action.

Though I can understand that the Green New Deal needs to appeal to Americans by centering on how environmental actions will improve the U.S., the points made in this lecture video about global socioeconomic injustice show that, even if we adopt the resolution, there are still further actions to take. The Green New Deal aims to provide justice to “frontline and vulnerable communities” in the U.S.. But, it fails to mention the vulnerable communities in places like Bangladesh, where they are heavily affected by climate related disasters despite contributing disproportionately less to the climate crisis. Because of this, I think that the U.S. has a responsibility to protect not only Americans, but others around the world that have also been affected by our actions. It is something necessary to address if something like the Green New Deal, according to its goals, will be implemented.

After reading the Green New Deal, my first impressions were: “Oh Wow!”. I did not know that the rise in global temperatures would do so much harm to the country’s people as well as infrastructure. Also, I did not know that the US has been impacted so much by climate change during the last few decades. It is good that the country is aware and attempting to resolves these issues. What does not make sense is that, even though the government has publicly announced these facts, but the corporations and many politicians are still ignoring these numerical facts and data which presents a big threat to the country. They are still trying to gain profit at the cost of people and animals’ lives. Do they not know the harms they are doing to the planet? Are they seriously leaving everything to the latter generation to solve? It is sad that the current president of the United States, who is supposed to lead the country to success and stability is still trying to rage wars and chaos and consistently ignoring these data that are open to the public. It is astonishing what money could do to people and what issues can money cause. This is the current reality, and it is up to us to save the planet, there is no other way, we cannot rely on the politicians and businesspeople anymore.

Harry I had the same reaction as you. This class as a whole has made me very disappointed in some our of current congress and politicians. People know that climate change is a problem yet they either ignore it or pay someone else to provide information to deny it so that they keep making money. It may not harm them in their life time but are they not thinking about their kids or their grandchildren? I honestly believe that climate change should be the number one problem on every persons mind because if we don't start making big changes now, it will seriously be too late. And it isn't that much to ask of people. Eat less meat, shop at thrift stores more often, ride your bike every now and then or take the bus. It is little switches to our daily lives that could make an impact. The only part of the Green New Deal that seemed too much was “upgrading all existing buildings in the United States and building new buildings to achieve maximum energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability, including through electrification." To upgrade every single building in the United States seemed like a very hard task to accomplish and not practical. Of course it would be extremely beneficial but if they want this bill to pass, they might have to think about the practicality of that happening.

Before reading the Green New Deal, I thought it was a super long dictation of rules being set against fossil fuel companies to combat huge companies. I had a completely different idea of the actual content of this proposed bill, but now I am amazed by how little I knew. A bill that addresses such an important topic that affects the entire planet is summarized into a couple of pages, yet no news media or educational platform encourages the public to read it. The news discusses the Green New Deal by summarizing in their "own words," but when doing so adds bias to the way they present the information. This has always made a negative impact because the opposing side then brands the information as "fake news" and it just continues back and forward. At the end of the day, nothing gets resolved as there is no actual conversation and both sides refuse to hear each other out. The Green New Deal is never truly discussed but just used as a weapon to dismiss each other. This is why I never truly knew what the Green Deal was about until I had to read it myself.

We need to implement the Green New Deal. I understand it is easier said than done but these resolutions are no longer something we hope gets implemented, the world needs them. People need clean air, clean water, basic rights, and healthy, organic food, these are not a want. And this needs to be regardless of race, sexuality, or income level.
               <br><br>
I really enjoyed this reading because I had heard so much about the Green New Deal in small snippets but had never read the whole bill. It would resolve so many dire issues in today’s society such as the discrimnation of women, immigrants, and impoverished people. It would also force the government to implement renewable energy sources and more cost-efficient and resource-efficient options for things like electricity, farming, and transportation to name a few. 
              <br><br>
Overall, I believe this deal is for the people and we should all vote in favor of this bill if we hope to prosper on this earth globally in a mindful way that caters to all life on this planet.

While reading the Green New Deal proposal, I could only wonder how this has not yet been implemented into our society. The draft itself is very well thought out and written incredibly well to the point where anyone who reads it can understand its purpose and goals. Having already learned about many of the topics addressed, it was very nice to see it all compiled into one single document.

              <br><br>

That being said, I feel like there has to be something fundamentally wrong with our current government and society if this thoroughly researched bill has not been approved. The document clearly states, without bias, what must be done in order to help better our planet. The goals are nothing short of reasonable and benefits, such as the creation of more jobs, were even included in the argument. From an outsider’s perspective, the bill would do a lot more good for the US and its citizens than it would do bad. I believe in this bill and hope that someday soon, we will be able to get it passed and finally be able to work towards turning our declining environment around.

I think it is safe to say that most environmental disasters, although without satisfying evidence, can be linked back to the United States. The U.S. is a global superpower and super-villain simultaneously. It has done marvelous things for the world and has also caused most of its destruction- I truly believe it is safe to admit that. The United States is glorified-mainly by itself. But it has no reason to because it is actually a terrible country. We may have more freedom and opportunity than anywhere else in the world-because we exploit the rest of the globe for it. The United States only cares about itself. And by "the United States" I mean politicians, the top 1%, ignorant citizens, and anyone within this country who has direct influence on this country's priorities. How does this relate to any of the videos? All we read, watch, and hear about is how the United States is the root of climate change and so many other global issues. There is no existing justification because you can't justify greed or non-action. You saw it yourself. Multiple times. Exxon and American politicians knew since the 70's. The U.S. is capable of solving this problem but it won't until life becomes more valuable than money. So fuck American patriotism. There's nothing to be patriotic about. This country is hiding too much.

After reading the Green New Deal, it’s obvious that this is just a skeleton of a bigger, more complex movement. It’s a great first step for combating climate change through American politics, especially considering the fact that our country has contributed so much to anthropogenic carbon emissions. A great point that Ken made was how every country has their own individual obstacles, goals, and methods in regards to preserving and bettering the environment. The Green New Deal is short and simple because environmentalists want the people to view it with the least amount of negativity. Admittedly, some parts of Green New Deal read more like vague, wishful thinking and not sturdy factual evidence. However, their message is clear, and its simplicity reflects the fact that it’s more difficult to argue against a fundamental outline than something that is more intricate.
              <br><br>
In response to the question of whether the US should input themselves into the Bangladesh situation, I think this country has more than enough of its own problems to handle. Looking through our history with Mexico and Iraq, it’s obvious that butting ourselves into situations only further complicates things. Especially considering the fact that there are better ways to promote sustainability other than manhandling other countries’ economies. And besides, who is our country to say what other nations should and should not do when we are the ones creating so much pollution and emissions? Even our most environmentally conscious cities can’t seem to live up to the expectations they set for others. All in all, I believe that the US should lead by example and stick to resolving our own issues.

Reading House Resolution 109, which is along with Senate Resolution 59 one of the 2 building blocks of the Green New Deal in the United States Congress, was the first time I’ve ever read any sort of government document in its entirety. I have never even read all of the Declaration of Independence. Knowing the grave threat that climate change poses to the security of not only our nation but the world as a whole, I was more than eager to read H. Res. 109 and see what our representatives in the House were really proposing. We hear all the time about little ways that we can, as individuals, reduce carbon emissions and help combat climate change. We also hear a lot about big initiatives that would require tons of people to weigh in to make a significant impact. Yet the Green New Deal is probably, in my opinion, the most comprehensive plan of action that we in the United States can initiate and take to combat the climate crisis. This is partly because it is an actual pair of resolutions, one made in the House of Representatives and the other in the Senate. It’s a truly remarkable plan put forth by members of our own government, and that is why I think it deserves to be considered the most important of any plans regarding climate change. 
              <br><br>

I was very happy to read Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s name first on the resolution. I am a big supporter of hers, and it delighted me when I found out that she serves as Representative for New York’s 14th congressional district. I was born in Queens, New York City, though of course I moved to California when I was only a kid. Still, I’ve visited NYC several times throughout my life. The specific part of Queens that I am from is a town called Flushing, and it is literally right on the edge outside of New York’s 14th congressional district, to the east of the district. So while AOC does not serve as a representative for my hometown exactly, it is extremely close and even being that close holds some symbolic value for me. I’m not a citizen living within the district that she represents but even still I am incredibly proud of her and the progressive movement that she is a part of. 
              <br><br>

I am a firm supporter of the Green New Deal and while I knew the major takeaway points of the plan, now that I have read H. Res. 109 I have a much more clear understanding of it. It inspires me to be more hopeful and optimistic regarding my future, knowing that our government is finally beginning to take the first steps of a long and grueling process to combat climate change.

I like how the Green New Deal puts an emphasis on frontline communities, those that are affected the most by the climate crisis, because as we've learned in, those that contribute the least to greenhouse gas emissions are those that suffer the most, and it is the responsibility of the government, and the U.S. as a country to address this injustice.
              <br><br>

I also like that it includes many of the solutions from project drawdown like more sustainable farming practices and diets, more investments in public transportation, etc. In a way, it's reassuring because we know that a government policy has been proposed, with a comprehensive plan, and that all it takes is for people to elect someone who will put these plans and policies into action. It is possible to enact change on a global level.

Like this comment, I was also very impressed with how they addressed lower income communities as well as proposed solutions that would impact everybody positively. It’s a very inclusive piece of legislation, that is very through and gives a very good plan for the future. Like that comment, I’m very happy that the imbalance of fairness with lower income neighborhoods is addressed and there is a proposed plan to fix it. It is completely unfair that the people in America that impact the climate the least with their emissions , suffer the most, while the rich people get to escape the worst impacts of it. For example, if someone with a higher income has their house burnt down, they could simply buy a new one while poorer people would be left without shelter. Realities like this need to be addressed by climate activists as well as politicians, as it will become a very pressing issue in the future. 
              <br><br>
While the proposed plan is very ambitious, it is needed. To be completely fossil-fuel free means restructuring our whole economy and each persons’ lifestyle, but with this plan this need becomes more publicized and many more people will know about it. However, to be able to achieve these goals will be a huge step with fossil fuel corporations doing their best to stop it, as well as other big companies whose' lifelines are fossil fuels. This would force change on American Citizens and I really hope it gets passed.

The video compares the impact of Bangladesh and the United States on the climate crisis. For example, Americans consume 265 pounds of meat a year, Bangladeshis consume only 4 pounds of meat a year, and 40 million people are starving. This set of data shocked me. In my previous study, I learned about the demand for meat products in the United States, and at the same time wasted a lot of these foods. And also in other aspects of the excessive production of goods, and finally these redundant goods can only be discarded. This not only wastes limited resources but also pollutes the environment. So I very much agree with the green new deal. It shows us the problems we are facing and also has solutions. We should be responsible for our actions. We should not destroy our living environment in order to satisfy our desires. We should show those developing countries the determination to solve the climate problem through practical actions.

While I read The Green New Deal, I was filled with the same sentiment of disappointment I was used to feeling while participating in my high school's Model United Nations club. The whole point of MUN was to simulate having a meeting with several other leaders to join the facts and the solutions into a document that is submitted to a higher authority or is approved through a vote, all this to fix a problematic situation in the world. In most of these documents we read and created in the club, I encountered the same issues: they were able to bring into light the main problems but only very vague semblances of solutions. "One must promote cleaner energy use", "it is our duty to ensure that all people have access to drinkable water ", etc. In some occasions, we detailed how we were going to achieve this goal, created an action plan of sorts and described how we would acquire funding, resources, etc and that's when we knew we had a good resolution . 

              <br><br>

In the case of The Green New Deal, it feels like a poorly made MUN resolution; it tells you exactly what needs to be done but it doesn't tell you how or with what resources. It proposes a lot of different things (reduce this, change that, ensure this, etc.) but it doesn't really say how they will do it. It's another verborrhagic document that serves to show the people "we are committing to THIS goal",  without actually committing to anything. It's a promising beginning in the sense that it means the problem is being recognized, but it doesn't mean that much else.

Yes I agree with you that this is a very general statement basically, and not really legislation to actually effect change. I think this is because of many reasons. For starters the politicians drafting this bill do not have all the answers, they just wanted to present a general idea of what needs to happen. Secondly, it's because they don't want to alienate the people voting on the bill. Even this "soft" version of an environmental bill has faced so much scrutiny, imagine if a full-fledged action plan was presented with sweeping changes that affected millions of people directly - it would have been ripped to pieces. This is more of just an introductory thing, testing the waters, seeing what catches and what doesn't, lower peoples sensitivity, preparing the ground for what's to come.
              <br><br>

I think this raises an interesting point. Look how slow the government is reacting to the climate crisis. It's gonna take years for any real change. Just as with nearly everything else, disruptors need to come in to push and accelerate change, and then the government will slowly take action too to align itself with the new realities.

The main thing I've taken away from this lecture video and from reading the Green New Deal was that the U.S. is doing the absolute least to help mitigate the climate crisis. They only continue to add to it while ignoring its impact on poorer countries like Bangladesh. The statistics speak for themselves. 4 in 1000 people own a car in Bangladesh whereas more than 800 in 1000 own a car in the U.S.. Moreover, The True Cost has shown that our country's fast fashion industry is literally killing people in countries like Bangladesh. We contribute about 20% of all carbon emissions. And who's suffering? Not U.S.

              <br><br>

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the kind of leader we need right now. The Green New Deal not only addresses this terrible statistic but encourages actions being taken towards investing in more sustainable practices and infrastructure. However, another very important thing addressed in this deal is the emphasis on frontline and vulnerable communities. The solution definitely starts with social change. The wealth gap and disparities in wealth and resources needs to be addressed. As the U.S. does not suffer while Bangladesh does, this occurs at the city and local level as well. Poorer communities lack reliable and quality infrastructure because funding is so low. All that money goes to wealthier communities. These vulnerable communities are also most often found in heavily industrial areas, plagued by overwhelming pollution, concrete, and factories. How do you think that affects people's health, education, and way of perceiving the world around them? AOC and the Green New Deal acknowledges this and aims to alleviate these social ills in connection to the environment.

Time and time again, we hear that developed countries contribute the most to the climate crisis, yet the countries who contribute the least will feel the effects the most. The US is not the one suffering, and consequently, the current politicians aren’t changing policy because the climate crisis does not appear to be in front of them. How selfish. As one of the world’s superpowers, the US should be at the forefront of mitigating climate change. Instead, we are static, stuck in our ways, and have yet to pass any bills for sweeping reform.
               <br><br>

Environmental Justice is a large issue in the climate crisis, and I too do believe that in order to solve the climate crisis, we also have to solve the overarching socio-economic problems. Social change is necessary; as the Green New Deal points out, the climate crisis magnifies systematic injustices. The climate crisis and inequality go hand and hand. One cannot be solved without the other, and that is why the Green New Deal is a step in the right direction, planning on creating more jobs and benefits for working-class families and communities of color.

I really enjoy how Ken decides to switch up the readings for each week, for example the week before we were reading different sections of a website, and this week we are reading about the political aspect of the climate crisis. I really liked the Green New Deal; seeing how changes can be implemented in America through policies and how they could potentially have a positive impact on the environment was really cool! There was definitely an interesting dichotomy that Ken presents in this lecture, like how we are faced with the problem of creating a better climate yet without hurting people in different countries and different cultures. However, I think overall the Green New Deal will be able to benefit so many low-income Americans and create a better society to live in for all, and of course at the end of the day it will have an insurmountable amount of positive changes for the climate, ultimately inhibiting the fast rate that the climate crisis accelerates at.

I also think that Ken’s decision to assign us the Green New Deal as a reading was a great idea. This is the first time that I’ve actually read the Green New Deal, even though I know what it argues for. I really believe that the U.S needs the Green New Deal. With it, I believe that we will be able to establish new infrastructure that would influence the world to follow. I also think that it could finally convince those that do not believe that climate change is harmful that it will be our downfall. 
               <br><br>
I like that Ken talks about social injustices around the world when it comes to the environment. He compares the meat consumption of the U.S. to Bangladesh, explains that some developing countries are just barely receiving technology that other countries may no longer rely on, and the different amount of resources that some countries receive over others. It’s common sense that wealthier countries have more resources to combat climate change, or natural disasters like the Thomas fire, but I did not realize that some countries don’t have the privilege of having first responders, clean water, etc. This reminds me of the Leonardo DiCaprio film, where DiCaprio was informed that some developing countries are barely implementing coal industries and they are being judged by other countries for not being sustainable when they don’t have the resources to do so. I believe that in order to help developing countries switch to more sustainable methods, developed countries need to set the example first and then share that technology and knowledge with the rest of the world.

<p>

watching Ken's commentary on social justice, environmental justice, and climate justice reminded me of the privilege that the United States and other developed countries hold when facing this crisis. We have learned from this course time and time again that the world's poorest countries, and the countries that have contributed the least to climate change, will suffer the most and are currently suffering the most amongst this crisis. And while there are effects of climate change that take place in the United States/developed countries, we have the funds and equipment to defend the people affected. Ken's example with the Thomas Fire is a reminder that we have the resources to minimize the damage done during a disaster, yet if a similar fire (or other environmental disasters) were to happen in a country such as Bangladesh it would be far more tragic. The concept of environmental justice is crucial because it reminds us all that the climate crisis affects every living thing on the planet, there are numerous injustices that come with it.

After reading through the Green New Deal, while I completely agree with the objective of the paper, which is to provide a baseline of action and objectives through which the U.S. may become zero-emissions, I believe that the way it goes about this incites the negative responses it has been receiving.

               <br><br>

The biggest issue with proposing a massive overhaul of the current coal and emission-based systems of transportation, energy, and labor markets is the glaring issue that millions of people will lose their jobs and livelihoods to the change, not just the large corporations that employ these workers. This issue MUST be addressed in some way, shape, or form if any meaningful change is to be made, because a large number of the people whose support must be won in order for action to be made are people whose livelihoods depend on coal and emissions-heavy trades.

               <br><br>

The Green New Deal is aware that it must address this issue, but fails to address it adequately enough to make it a strong proposal. It rightly claims that the overhaul of the coal-based system would create a whole new market of jobs, but that alone is not a good enough answer. It loosely claims that the government must ensure "frontline and vulnerable communities shall not be adversely affected", but fails to elaborate or give any meaningful ideas on how this is to be done. It outlines all the large-scale steps that must be taken to move towards zero-emissions, but all these steps will necessitate massive costs, and the funds to pay for those costs must come from somewhere, and it doesn't specify where. Thus, the paper comes off as naive and too idealistic for the vicious reality of a capitalist economy.

I agree that the Green New Deal lacks a lot of specifications when it comes to funding and the effects on those of us who's livelihoods depend on fossil fuel industries, and many climate activists demonize the heads of these fossil fuel companies. The lavishly rich oil tycoons are all we see benefitting from the fossil fuel industry, when in reality many average middle to lower class Americans make a living working for these people. Putting so many people without work and no clear answer as to how we create new jobs for them would be disastrous for our country, and a much more solid plan with concrete answers is required before action can be taken. As dire as our situation is to make a change to protect the environment, if it is done wrong we will only return to our normal ways and continue to put off permanent and effective policy.
               <br><br>

To address the question of helping other countries in preventing catastrophic climate damage and effects, I think we have a responsibility to step up in areas that are underdeveloped and not heavily reliant on the fossil fuel industry to prevent them from making the same mistakes we did. We have to reverse the damage we have done, and doing so will be very difficult with the established capitalist economy we have. In the midst of our unclear climate action plans, we should help other countries be proactive and practice sustainability so we are at least doing SOMETHING for the planet. We did kinda screw the rest of the world over so we kinda owe it to them. But the same issue arises with unclear sources of funding and why we would spend money abroad instead of domestically.

If I'm being completely honest, I did not know much about the Green New Deal before reading the actual resolution. I knew that it centered around shifting the U.S. energy sector towards renewables, but I had no idea that the implications it presented in terms of restructuring our entire economy without the reliance on fossil fuels. At first glance, this sent chills down my spine. How could we force so many people out of jobs and replace them with industries that have entirely different experience and education requirements? I then quickly realized that this issue runs much deeper than job security.
               <br><br>


At the Earth's current heating rate, we will increase the average global temperature by 2.5 degrees C within the next century. This will result in mass migrations, increasing frequencies of climate-related disasters (intense hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, etc), and large-scale wildlife displacement. This goes to show that this issue is being dealt with by all species across the planet, and they will be the same ones to face the consequences for the actions of one species. Thus, on a theoretical level, the Green New Deal actually seems like a pretty moderate solution in terms of changing our lifestyles to help save the planet.

This may make sense theoretically, but how will it work in practice? Sure, the resolution lists many social programs that will help counteract the impacts that will take place on the population, such as guaranteed education and housing in low-income communities that will suffer the most from this transition. But do we even know how long it will take to become comfortable with this new renewable economy, and how long the potential side effects will last?
               <br><br>


I am in no way doubting the potential of the Green New Deal in reducing the carbon emissions of the United States. I am just asking these questions in order to cover all aspects of the resolution, just to make sure that we know where we are headed if this bill is passed. If all of these questions can be answered at the federal level, then it would make more sense to move forward with passing the bill and beginning to work on this milestone transition.

I have to start off by thanking Ken for putting all of this information into perspective. At times it is hard to imagine the proportion of the issue at hand when it is the only thing that we are looking at. By Ken comparing the United States to Bangladesh in this video, it helped put a lot of things into perspective for me. Just comparing the statistics alone of Bangladesh compared to America really disturbed me. It was really weird hearing that only 4/1000 people in Bangladesh own a car, compared to America where 838/1000 people own a car. Something else that surprised me was that America’s meat consumption is 6600% higher than Bangladesh, and America’s air travel is 14000% greater than Bangladesh. These facts were somewhat expected but I didn’t expect the numbers to be that high.
                <br><br>
What really shocked me was the natural disasters that strike Bangladesh every year. I never heard of this happening, which is terrible because many are losing their lives or are being displaced. It’s frustrating knowing that Bangladesh isn’t the country putting out the majority of carbon emissions, but they are the ones that have to suffer the consequences. This is why I support the Green New Deal, because if America steps up to the plate and takes responsibility for their actions, I am sure the rest of the world will soon follow. It’s disturbing to think that I for the most part live an easy and carefree life while people from the other side of the globe have to suffer for what I do.

I agree with you that seeing the statistics of Bangladesh in comparison to America was really helpful. However, I was not taken by surprise when I heard the disparities between the two in comparison. America is a much bigger consumer because we have advanced more quickly and Bangladesh is still developing. As sad as it is you are right, even though we have reaped the benefits of our industrialized society, developing worlds are experiencing the consequences. In response to your comment about natural disasters, what hit me the hardest was when ken compared the outcome of the Thomas fire here to the reality that people from Bangladesh would face due to not having the infrastructure to combat their natural disasters. We think that people have the right to LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, however people are loosing their lives in developing countries because they can't afford to combat the natural disasters in response to a change in climate that we Americans have brought about. 
                  <br><br>
   If the Green New Deal is really the way that we can bring about social and environmental justice then I think more Americans need to be educated about it so that they can vote in an informed manner rather than taking what they hear in the media at face value.

Reading the Green New Deal, I was struck by how inclusive the language was. For the document to physically state the needs of colored and indigenous communities on paper is a huge deal because these groups too often get swept under the carpet unjustly and are left to deal with the disproportionate mess left behind by their white counterparts. 
                  <br><br>
The document is also one of the most forward statements about climate change in the US from Washington, making it an even bigger deal. Hopefully, it will actually get traction once elections are over because it has the potential to do a lot of good for the economy and the environment.

Madison, I had a similar reaction to this reading. I thought it was interesting how they emphasized the communities who are effected most by the climate crisis. As we have discussed in class, these communities are the ones most severely impacted by the climate crisis and are the population with the least impact on the crisis itself. Not only is this unfair, but is morally wrong. Because of my stance on this issue, I thought that it was very interesting and inspiring that they had included this in the green deal. 
                  <br><br>
I also think it was interesting that they mentioned how the US should be a leader in this crisis seeing as the US is a huge contributer of the harmful emissions that are killing our planet. I completely agree and think that this concept should be implemented globally with stricter rules so that we can actually start making a change and not just sitting back and letting the situation get worse and worse.


<br><hr>
Reading your comment, I found myself nodding. When I read the green new deal, I also found myself shocked by how straightforward it was, especially in terms of how much the climate crisis would be affecting indigenous people, peoples of color, low-income families and so on. They even referred to it as a "systematic injustice," something I thought the government would be too prideful to admit. To me, and like you said, this is "a huge deal" because it finally recognizes all kinds of people and emphasizes how serious the climate crisis is, as well as how large its impacts will be felt. This document was very inclusive and direct, but hopefully this also means that people will look at it more seriously and use it to help the environment and economy.

The Green New Deal really made readers realize how extensive, and the large amount of work people need to do in order to fix our environment. I really appreciated how the document as a whole was inclusive and clear for readers so it was easy to understand the meaning . The document really showed the effect it would have on workers of the oil and gas industry if they to be closed down for the environments sake. The Green New Deal really gives these workers hope if their future was more environmentally friendly and allows them to be more open to these changes.

Knowing that there are resolution to help improve this climate crisis makes you feel hope. At first I was pretty impressed about all these ideas being suggested however I started to notice that they sounded too good to be true. As you said it yourself they are extensive and are going to take a large amount of work. The way it is listed and presented makes it seem easy and possible. We all know that not everyone is on board with this crisis and that living up to those resolution will be pretty hard. Saying thay they want to secure a future for all people is cool in all but we need actions being done.

Without a doubt, the United States should help countries such as Bangladesh in times of need in regard to the Climate Crisis. Due to the fact that this country is solely responsible for pumping in the most amount of Greenhouse Gases due to our lifestyle, this is a problem that we have to solve. As mentioned in the Green New Deal, the United States should switch our economy and cultural ways to be an example for other countries to model. It would be beneficial if we also aided developing countries that are developing using renewable energy sources because it would help the country and the planet.

                  <br><br>

The United States is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and so I feel we have a responsibility to be one of the leading powers in the fight against the Climate Crisis. Other countries such as Denmark and Switzerland have already taken measures to do what they can to lower their emissions. Why can’t the United States do the same? We finally have a plan on how to go about this issue with the Green New Deal, so there is no excuse for why we are not acting swiftly. The country is afraid of change and this proposal changes, but we should not fear it. When something is broken and is not working the way it should, what do you do? You change it. Our way of life is destroying the planet and is affecting all life around the world, so we need to take huge measures to address this issue.

After reading the green new deal I found myself wondering why more people were taking this seriously. The consequences are drastic and people are taking it something to believe in or not, like religion or hypnotism. People need to wake up and realize that if the green new deal isn't being put in place there will be nothing to believe in because there won't be earth anymore. The green new deal is basically an outline of what would happen or will happen if something isn't done now and major changes aren't made. 
                  <br><br>

I believe that all people should be able to have access to clean water, good oxygen, and sustainable resources. But the facts are that if climate change isn't stopped now the people with the least access to these arent going to be the rich people. Wealthy people and middle-class people will be much more able to afford clean water and buy the more expensive product after we have a shortage of both of those. It will be the low income and poor people who do the least to contribute to the climate change that will be the most affected by the rising CO2 levels.

The thing I appreciate the most about this lecture video is you bringing up the concept of "degrowth." I have always had this mindset that we, as the United States, needed to find someway to mitigate the climate crisis situation while still having the same output of resources we use everyday. It is eye opening to now realize that this isn't feasible if we want a planet for our kids to live in. It's crucial we start reducing literally everything that has as major impact on carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. Statistically, we eat 6600% more meat than other developing countries, travel in the air 14,000% more, and auto ownership is 21,000% greater. These numbers are absurd and it only proves the greediness of ourselves. Although it may be difficult, we are going to have to transition to a plant-based food economy and we have to start helping developing countries like Bangladesh establish environmental laws.

I honestly forget sometimes how ignorant the U.S. is about how excessive our consumerism habits are. As one of the richest and most resource-abundant nations, I feel like we need to grasp how fortunate we are and how much we abuse our power. Compared to Bangladesh, we consume an excessive amount of meat and we emit more greenhouse gases. The green new deal would save our nation and would help preserve our Earth and environment. Do we understand the repercussions of owning an automobile? Not eating a mainly plant-based diet? Or flying excessively? I just want everyone to be educated about their contribution to emitting carbon and harmful gases. I am so thankful for this class and what it has taught me. Truly, this course has opened my eyes.


<Br><hr>
I agree that the output we have right now is not sustainable and we should reduce our consumerism, but switching entirely to a plant based diet is not necessary. There are other ways we can reduce our carbon footprint besides vegetarianism or veganism. Reducing waste and reusing products is a step we can take. Switching to electricity over gas is also a way to solve the carbon footprints of cars and planes. It takes a large toll on the environment in the production stages of electric vehicles, but if everything is switched to electricity, there would be no problem. The current rate of meat production is unreasonable and definitely must be slowed and regressed, but meat can also now be grown in labs, providing another source rather than land and food consuming animal husbandry.

I think Ken raises several important points in this video. The impacts of climate change are already very apparent in the U.S. as evidenced by the Thomas Fire which around half of this class was here to experience firsthand. The fire was (for a brief time) the most catastrophic in the history of California, burning more than 440 square miles in total and claiming two lives. To be sure, this fire was significant and the resulting damages and mudslides terrible, but as Ken noted, in the majority of countries around the world, the damage and lives lost from a comparable event of this magnitude would be nearly unfathomable. What are individuals who live in developing countries with limited resources supposed to do? Sit back and accept defeat? Wait for death (caused by a number of environmental factors all stemming from massive emissions of CO2 from countries like the U.S.)? Our current administration seems more than content with this prognosis and to that point has reduced the funding/aid allocated to Bangladesh, most significantly to the health sector. With floods that seasonally cover up to 75% percent of the country, I can only imagine the massive spike in rate of disease with water mixing with what I can only assume to be a cesspool of trash, sewage, rotting food, animal byproduct, etc. This is not to mention the various physical health challenges that the increasingly massive seasonal flooding must pose for disabled, elderly, and extremely young individuals. How can these people keep themselves and their families safe, let alone provided for, when everything they own is annually wiped out and needs to be rebuilt again, especially when what little aid they receive from the people who caused this mess is being slashed and pulled? 
                   <br><br>

         To refuse or reduce aid to Bangladesh and countries like it is to accept the blood and lives of countless other innocent humans on our own hands. We consistently prioritize the lives and wellness of the wealthy over the poor and try to convince ourselves that our massive growth under capitalism is the true marker of success and worth in this world. But I would argue the exact opposite. The growth and greed that has been bred out of unchecked capitalism is the plague that will ultimately doom our species and all but destroy our planet if it is to go unchanged for much longer.

I think that it is really difficult to decide whether or not we are to intervene in other countries– particularly from the global south– business. I say this because we have caused so much harm to other nations under false pretences, from our long history of colonialism supporting to authoritarian regimes in South America and the Middle East to the current administration basically disowning Puerto Rico after disaster runs the bill up. Historically, we have caused more harm than good. And as such I think that we have to be extremely cautious when thinking of inserting ourselves into other countries' affairs especially due to power dynamics that have been built over the past two hundred years. 
                   <br><br>
While I would love to ensure more safety and stability in the global south, the nations who will be most negatively effected by climate change while contributing to it the least, I think that it will take an incredibly thoughtful, comprehensive plan which was developed in conjunction with each individual nation. I think that it can be done but that it would take an immense amount of time to be created and another long period of time until it could be accepted by the public and put into place in our government. In all honesty, not that we shouldn't try, but it would take so long that I think trying would be futile in the face of the fast paced climatic changes. I hate that I think this, I like to be an optimist, but when our own country is still divided on whether climate change is real or not, I do not think that the majority will be in favor of us diverting our own resources to other countries to combat climate change there– even though in truth it is our fault. 
                   <br><br>
I find the idea of degrowth all the more alluring as time goes on. There is a flaw in our current economic ideology– that there can be infinite growth. This cannot be true on a planet with finite resources and exhausted environmental sinks. Our planet cannot take anymore growth but needs new forms of distribution of food, wealth, education, etc. Degrowth is one of my favorite theoretical solutions as it would mean slowing the pace of our lifestyles, increasing happiness, decrease environmental degradation and seemingly improve most aspects of life.

Nothing stood out to me as particularly radical within the Green New Deal. It outlined the measures that needed to be taken as well as the consequences we would have to face if we failed to follow them. If anything, I see it as a comprehensive plan to effectively battle the number one biggest problem facing both the world and our nation. I enjoyed this reading a lot because it provided me with substance that I could follow and that I didn't have to chase after myself. The plan is layed out for us clear and simple. This is the problem that we are facing. This is how we can fix it. This is how we can protect our people from the negative consequences. The fact that AOC presented such a meaningful idea to the front of congress during her first term is incredible. The Green New Deal could have such a profound impact on the restructuring of our economy and bring so many jobs to light. Many people are scared that they would lose their jobs, but the reality is that it is more like a reshuffling of jobs rather than a loss of them. This plan requires a reorganization of everything from almost every level so many jobs will be built around the nation locally and in large industrial sectors. 
                   <br><br>

I hope that the Green New Deal sets a precedent for all future legislation to come. I hope that our legislators consider the environment whenever they propose changes. This is the kind of change that needs to happen, and it needs to happen now.

I was really intrigued while reading the Green New Deal and how it addressed climate change and the economic inequality. After watching Ken’s video – Social justice, environmental justice, climate justice, and the injustice of it all – I got a new sense of how different the United States is from so many other countries and how vast and unnecessary our needs are. I strongly believe that it is part of the United States’ job to help third world and developing countries with the fact of the climate crisis because we benefit so much off them and they are left with so little. We have the ability to create change but instead we are just making the climate change situation worse. Our unnecessary large desires such are devastating to the environment. We may think that we get justice through our hard work in the sense that we are receiving great rewards, but in reality it is an injustice to the people in developing countries and, more importantly, an injustice to the earth itself. We can do so much to stop this climate crisis, but large corporations in the United States are more concerned with their profits. I really hope that we can educate more people about how detrimental our actions are to the rest of the world and start creating change towards mitigating and eventually stopping this climate crisis.

I, too, was intrigued and also concerned about the economic inequality. On top of that, reading and knowing about the racial and gender discrimination in the work force really upsets me because it seems like regardless of the movements many acvivists have towards gaining equality on all scopes of life, realistically, there will always be a divider in terms of income. Yes, there are movements that voice the need to be treated fairly, but at the end of the day that doesn’t change the fact that the majority of white families are wealthier than black families, and women are still paid less than men. As a female, if I received the same bachelor's degree, masters degree, and the same medical school as a male peer, would I still make less money than him in the future? Yes. To put the icing on the cake, according to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, for a black woman to earn as much as a white man does in the same year, with the same job, is seven months. Seven extra months to balance the pay between a black woman and a white man is insanely mind boggling, especially in a country that takes pride in being a place of freedom and equality. Maybe America would be such a place in a different reality. 
                   <br><br>

Additionally, reading how numerous citizens of the United States fail to receive healthcare, or don’t have access to healthcare is disappointing. Healthcare and health in general is one of the main necessities of life, and obviously this dilemma correlates to the lessened life expectancy of the average American. There are so many injustices that the Green New Deal hopes to lessen/extinguish, and it gives me hope for the future of this country. It shows how there are steps wanting to be taken to achieve the goal of not exceeding a 1.5-degree rise in temperature, and addresses the topic of injustice in general. After reading this Resolution, it is evident that there are people with power (House of Reps/Federal Govt) that do have the mindset of wanting certain change, and hopefully this agenda falls through.

The concept of “degrowth” is pretty important and necessary for the developed world. As people become wealthy enough, it is time to think about how to live a more fulfilled and meaningful life. How to live a meaningful life? In concern of the climate crisis, dedicating themselves to mitigating the climate change is one possible direction. How to achieve environmental, climate, and social justice is something worthwhile of considering. While we are wealthy enough to defend ourselves from the climate change, there are still many people out there who are paralyzed when facing environmental disasters. We can surely help them with our technology and wealth. Helping others can definitely be a fulfilling deed that we would honor in the rest of our life. Clearly, we should stop being a climate criminal who cause most of the global greenhouse emission while leaving the poorest people in the world suffering for their crimes. These people do not deserve that. They deserve something much better than this. Even if you do not care about their lives, we should think about how to make our life more meaningful than this. We should help them as long as we can and as much as we can.

I agree. In this video, Ken brought up a point how the United States has the money to defend itself against the effects of climate change from the money we have made from producing and emitting fossil fuels. I had never thought about climate injustice in this way before. However, it makes you wonder what we could be doing with that money in terms of sustainability efforts. And with the topic of “degrowth”, could we sustain an economy where we can support both sustainability efforts and combating climate change effects even if we close off the fossil fuel sector? 
                   <br><br>


Furthermore, I agree that what we put out to the rest of the world needs to be just. Instead of just providing remediation, like technology and medicine as you mention, for the climate effects that we cause, we need to target the source of the injustice. We need to change our ways, not only for the planet, but to benefit those who are suffering despite any fault.

This week's reading “Green New Deal” was a refreshing shift from our usual readings. I found it interesting  to read about the climate crisis from a political point of view. This document has the potential to insight the systematic change our nation and world need.  As we have talked about before the United States is responsible for “a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions” as stated in the Green New Deal. This document is an outlet for the United States to take responsibility for its actions in the climate crisis. More than this though, the United States also has a duty to take care of its citizens and invest in a Green New Deal for National Security and security for all people now and in future generations. 
                   <br><br>

In order to make such advancements like the Green New Deal we must start small with our first world problems. Americans need to reduce (at least) their meat consumption,  air travel, waste, and on top of it all gain some perspective. As stated in this video when comparing the United States to a developing country our statistics are extremely disheartening. I am thankful you brought up the concept of “degrowth”. I find it infuriating that even some that are passionate about the climate crisis think that we can continue with our current economic model. Our consumerist and capitalist ideals as a nation have been at the expense of our planet and we must start to change that.

I also really liked having the green new deal assigned as our reading this week. I had heard a lot about it in the media.  I had heard about it from peers and people I knew, always in the context of politics.  I couldn't tell what it was, I couldn't tell if I thought it was positive or negative.  I didn't know if it was legislation or a deal between countries or states or private organizations.  I guess I should have known subconsciously this is a public document that I could have viewed at any time, but having it assigned in class was probably the only way I was going to read it.   What I took away from the document is that it isn't legislation, it isn't partisan, it isn't accusatory and it's not suggesting anything impossible.  Simply, it's asking American people and government to acknowledge we are on the course to irreparable damage.  It's a document attempting to influence people to slam on the breaks as fast as we can.  I guess it's too bad that it must be viewed so politically, as far left liberals destroying the stable economy hard working conservatives have built.  It's not that.  I don't know why it seems like the more liberal groups are more accepting of ecological phenomenon, I wonder if maybe there are less ties to big business? It seems like both sides have their own corruption and it seems silly that this is a political argument.  No one wants to admit this.  We can't even fathom how unbelievably screwed we are and how practically every single one of our practices is unsustainable in the sense that it will breed huge ecological disaster.  I liked reading the green new deal because the media was painting it as a huge partisan issue.  Really it's just a push to admitting that we have not been living responsibly and that if we want human life to continue we must readjust our practices.


<br><hr>
I also found this week's reading really interesting to me. " Green New Deal " offers resolutions to the government. As the deal explains, we now have many problems in our environment. For instance, pollution and climate crisis like storms cause a great loss to the society and individuals. Once a disaster caused by climate crisis happens, millions of people or even billions of people suffer from it. Without sustainable environment, we will suffer more. In coastal cities like Miami and Amsterdam, rising sea levels have already led to billions of loss to the government. The government and all citizens should be responsible for the upcoming world crisis. 
                   <br><br>
For the government, they should shut down heavy polluting plants to make the country clean. Officials ought to increase CO2 emission standards for all companies. Take Airlines as examples, the states can set co2 emission standards for all airlines like Delta and United. After standards come out, plane manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus will also follow to make planes that are more environment friendly.
                   <br><br>
For individuals, as Claire mentioned, we all should reduce our meat consumption and air travel. Whatever we are living in a developed or developing country, we all should not waste. Protecting the environment seems little to everyone, but when we fight together, the power is huge!

To be perfectly honest, going into this week’s reading I truly had no idea what the Green Deal was or even that it was making a difference in terms of climate change. After reading the green deal in its entirety, I feel like I am now more equipped to educate others on it and help people understand more the true impact of what the Green Deal has to offer. Also coming into this week’s assignment, I didn’t really know what the government was doing, if anything, to mitigate the effects the climate crisis has on its constituents and I’m glad we’re starting to take a step in the right direction. I wish more people knew about the Green Deal considering I didn’t even know what the Green Deal was and I consider myself to be pretty politically active. If more people knew the effects of the Green Deal, I feel like there would be more voices to support other environmentally efficient laws and deals in order to shift our American society into an age of environmental sustainability.

I have some qualms about the government’s involvement in the climate crisis. From previous exposure to films like An Inconvenient Truth and other material in this class, I have quite a bit of uncertainty in leaving some of this delicate issue in the hands of politicians with questionably unethical practices and strategies in their campaigns and agenda. Honestly, I can not say too much regarding this issue because I am not updated on the current happenings in the political arena. Given that, I do like that the message of the Green New Deal is fairly straightforward and not hidden behind extravagant, highly academic diction. This provides more transparency of the government’s intentions and ideological actions to the general public. The proposition of this deal appears to encompass the desires of the American population while ensuring the security of necessary goods for all, which I think strikes a decent balance in the priorities of this nation.

I was surprised by how the Green New Deal focused on the need for economic change in the U.S., including bringing back higher-paying industrial jobs and providing security for all citizens. I thought that it would focus more on proposing solutions to the climate crisis directly, not in such a roundabout way. This isn't to knock AOC's proposed legislature, however; the Green New Deal is absolutely the type of work that Americans need from the government in the 21st century. When I was reading, I was less surprised by the focus on the economy and the dignity of minority groups when I figured out why it was titled as an homage to Roosevelt's New Deal; Roosevelt was invested in increasing the economic prosperity of Americans, and one method that he used was opening up land restoration and conservation jobs. I thought that the Green New Deal was a fantastic reboot for the next century: it too, offers hope and an actionable plan when many things seem hopeless.

                   <br><br>

For the topic of Bangladesh, I absolutely think that we owe the nation and its people reparations. If the U.S. wants to call itself a "global leader" and a "superpower" that models what other nations should be doing, then we need to be green, at home and abroad, and start to value human life and human dignity, both at home and abroad. We have the technology and the money as a nation to improve the lives of people who work in our factories overseas. If we can help out (which we have the capability to) then I think we have a moral responsibility to repair the damage that we have done in our quest for a consumerist paradise.

I really like how Emma worded her thoughts on the Green New Deal and the U.S.’s responsibility pertaining to their relation with Bangladesh. 
                   <br><br>

I, too, think that the Green New Deal (GND) is exactly what we need in our current political, environmental, and social climate. With major Federal Government legislations like the GND, I think it’s important to state the most ideal outcome and any and all the thought-out goals. Some resolutions like goal (K), “restoring and protecting… ecosystems through locally appropriate and science-based projects” (GND), to me, came across as vague at first, but I realized with such a global and complex issue, it’s okay for legislation from the federal government to be broad. It acts as a framework, the “big idea,” for state and local governments and communities to look to and take inspiration from when implementing realistic actions. The Green New Deal is a great model; its tie to Roosevelt's New Deal definitely provokes a similar type of hope, while also being more inclusive of members of frontline and vulnerable communities who were excluded from the original Deal. 
                   <br><br>

As for the case with Bangladesh, I also think the U.S. needs to be held accountable for the consequences of its selfish actions. It would be unethical to call the U.S. a “global leader” if the country doesn’t take responsibility and take actions to ameliorate the environmental, social, and climate injustices the country has inflicted on Bangladesh. There is no fairness in the fact that 40% of Americans are obese while around 40 million people across Bangladesh are starving (Ken). In its current position, the U.S.’s “superpower” is its ability to cause so much damage and its ability to ignore valuing human life. Where is America’s dignity? One can consider America a “supervillain” because it cares little about countries that aren't itself.

The green new deal does a great job of summarizing what is happening in our climate culture and what is to develop in our future. For example, if 2°C is gained in our global temperature, there will be mass migration, and 99% of the coral reeves will die. Like many other films, it emphasizes the US contribution as being the most significant of them all. Because we buy things from different countries and contribute to a majority of their contributions as well. I was in rolled in English 23, so I have heard many of these facts, but still this way, it’s me that Most people affected by global have contributed very little to it. We will suffer very little from it. We will all feel the consequences are disappointing that the wealthier population that has caused this isn’t going to hurt the result. But we will all suffer the consequence. From what I learned in the green new deal, I feel that the amount of innovation that we bring to technology is so my note that we should stop innovative other than in the medical field and that we should lower production and have a carbon tax for everyThing produced. Most things are junk like a fan that connects to the bottom of your phone and is run by the battery. A lot of materials labor and time are used for such a dumb item that will be discarded probably within the first week of getting it or immediately. Let us buy quality instead of taking in mass amounts of junk.

Reading the “Green New Deal,” they discuss the seriousness of climate change and the United States' role in it. I thought that this was important because it emphasizes America’s large contribution to the climate crisis and how we need to be the ones to fix it. Before reading this, I understood that the climate crisis would be affecting underdeveloped countries first. I knew that the hurricanes and floodings that have been happening are already affecting islands and areas that barely contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and have a small carbon footprint. However, I never considered how the climate crisis would also be affecting the United States in a similar systematic way, in terms of classes and their environment. It was interesting that they acknowledged the climate crisis as a “systematic injustice” because it’s so true but it never really entered my mind in that way. The climate crisis would “disproportionately affect indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth (referred to in this preamble as “frontline and vulnerable communities.” 
                   <br><br>

Realizing this, I think it should motivate people to take the climate crisis more seriously because we will all be feeling its consequences whether we’re in a developed country or not. In this sense, I do think that the United States has a responsibility to help countries like Bangladesh to make sure that they have strong environmental laws that would prevent the production of stuff for the US. And we should help them when they suffer the consequences of it as well. The United States has already contributed 2/3 of greenhouse gas emissions, and to push other countries to also contribute to this by making products for us is an injustice, especially when they would feel its negative impacts first. I think the Green New Deal will be a great start in allowing the United States to make up for the damage we’ve already caused. It is our duty to prioritize the environment and the different communities first.

I also agree that the importance of America’s role in the climate crisis is significant and should be acknowledged more. I really admire the way that the Green New Deal not only held the United States accountable for its significant impact on climate change but offers ways to help the other less developed places in the world that would feel the impacts more. Many fail to acknowledge the significance that the United States has in climate change not only because of the economic standpoint but because of the pressure that comes with the responsibility of the extent of repenting for our actions as a nation. The economic impact that we have discussed before shows how the Green New Deal can show the transition into a sustainable economy. This extends to the impact we need to have on other nations that are unable to help themselves in the way we are able to. Adrianne brings up a very important point with how climate change even in the United States will affect people in a systematic social class order. Not only is this problem evident in other nations currently but it will quickly become a problem here too. We can no longer hide behind the idea that climate change won't be a problem that we see everyday. As time goes on this will only get worse. Most of us, as it goes, are not part of the richest one percent. With that, Adrianne is extremely correct in the point of the importance that climate change be taken seriously immediately. People are people regardless of where they live. Be it in the United States or in Bangladesh. Especially since they are suffering from our actions, it is our civic duty to do whatever we can to help those that need it. Adrianne reflects another good point of how the United States has contributed two thirds of greenhouse emissions and owes to aid the prevention of further contamination of the environment as well as the damage that has already been done.


<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. The facts stating in Ken's video are heart-breaking facts. Before reading, I had an idea that climate change will influence less developed countries but I didn't notice the extent of the damages and the huge gap between developed countries and developing countries. It's just astonishing to accept the fact that climate change is, and will continue influence every part on the earth. It will influence everyone who is living on the earth without exception. The Green New Deal addresses the environmental problem in different angles that provide a comprehensive understanding of the climate change we are undergoing now. The economic disproportional development among different countries is the fundamental reason why the climate change has different impacts on people. 
                   <br><br>
United States being the country with the biggest greenhouse gas emissions should take its responsibility to help the less developed countries with their economic development and their environmental crisis. US should do this because at the end, people are united as a whole to fight against climate change. Our destinies are connected together regardless of race, gender and color. We should fight the climate change as a united group.

I think the video by Ken this time influence me more than what the reading “The Green New Deal” does. The data that professor Ken gave in the video are all very meaningful and heartbreaking. The unfair thing is not that Bangladesh’s people are suffering because its country is not developing rapidly enough to reach American’s lifestyles. The unfair thing is that some of the terrible things they are experiencing are due to the American lifestyle. Thus, since America kind of start the whole consumerism and exploitation of the earth, America should stand out and make the change.
                   <br><br>

For a really long time, American has been a good example and leader for the world because of its technology development, academic achievement, and so on. Every country wants to achieve what American has achieved, so it sorts of set a standard of what a successful and powerful country should be like. However. the world is now facing another problem, a big serious problem. I think there should be a developed country to stand out and be the leader to set another standard of what a great country should do to contribute to our environment and start another kind of more meaningful life, and then, this could be a goal for the rest of the developing world. According to the situation now, American is the best choice to be the leader to create another standard of success, and, as Ken said, Americans can promote this idea by helping more and more developing countries so that they can be more efficient in using energy or natural resource too.

I agree with this comment.  Though reading the Green New Deal was helpful, it was the video that carried more of an impact.  It is unsettling to know the level of second hand destruction and suffering America is inflicting on other parts of the world such as Bangladesh (by second hand destruction, I mean damage not directly caused by our presence).  Furthermore, our relative wealth will allow us to destroy decent portions of the developing world before we start to feel the effects of our lifestyles.  

                   <br><br>

I also agree that America needs to be the one to make the change.  Many other countries will not feel motivated to make progress against the climate crisis until they see a global leader offering a path forward.  This is evident as several smaller countries (such as the Scandinavian countries) have already made many of the steps necessary to combat the crisis.  But their actions have not influenced other countries worldwide as their political and economic power is negligible compared to the superpowers.  America needs to help spearhead this movement, so that it will have weight and meaning.  This will allow developing countries to create a society based of other forms of energy that will be more beneficial for the world in the long run.


<br><hr>
I agree that the 2nd part of the Green New Deal that explains how it will protect and help people and other countries is important. Not only because it is our fault, but also because we are one earth even if we’re far from the suffering countries. I feel like I see a country in a different country as being disconnected and not knowing how living there would be. But during this climate crisis, we’ve seen wildfires here in California and other disasters occurring. That is sadly a connection and similarity we have with other countries. BUT, they have it worse. It’s sad to think how it is America’s doing, yet others suffer so much more. It’s an obvious reason to help other countries whether it’s because we caused it, but also just morally. How could America claim to be a great country by leaving others to suffer from our actions?

The Green New Deal sounds like an effective and overall good solution on paper, but I’m curious as to how it would play out in actuality. Because The Green New Deal also has a focus on cultivating equality for minority groups like people of color, women, and low-income families, there is a potential of societal advancement through this being put in place. Although The Green New Deal is laid out eloquently, I almost feel like it’s too good to be true. I have concerns about the chance of inaction due to the ambiguity of the deal and how it could be misconstrued. Furthermore, because The Green New Deal requires so much to become established, we would need to sway many political figures when they don’t even think climate change is real which is discouraging and makes the plan seem impossible. 

                   <br><br>

Ken’s lecture about our first-world problems was very humbling because he highlights how many of the things we should consume less of to be more environmentally sustainable are a huge luxury that countries like Bangladesh rarely have access to. This reminds us of how although Americans contribute by far the most to climate change, we don’t live like we do and feel the effects of it far less than those in developing countries. The ways in which extremely environmentally ignorant things have been normalized like rampant materialism and meat consumption is worrisome because now, comfortable Americans don’t want to change their ways because they don’t want to lose their “freedom”. I can only understand this idea to an extent before realizing how extremely selfish and close-minded it is. Even though there are many Americans who feel this way, I think the Green New Deal is a step in the right direction and could open up doors for more systemic change and recognition in regard to the environment.

I also agree with you that the Green New Deal is a step in the right direction, but it seems as it is too big of a generalized idea to actually happen. Most (including myself) only knew about the Green New Deal because of the constant ridicule posed by the Republican Party and no one really understood or knew its actual content. Although it seems like a great solution and a do-able one, I know it will most likely not succeed no matter how hard we try. It is hard to be optimistic when everything is going left, but I just don't think it is going to happen just from the direction it is in right now. Many Republican politicians are using this as their 'leg up' against their competitors to show that they have the right ideals in mind, and it is driving more people farther away from the real truth of our future. Your point on the concern about the chance of inaction and misconstruism is extremely on point in the fact that it is used as a form of tactical framing in the face of future elections. As long as we continue to allow the Republican Party to win, we are going to continue to lose.
                   <br><br>
I feel repetitive stating how Ken's lecture in every video surprised me through all of the big numbers and statistics used, but it does every single time. As the world's largest and wealthiest economy, it is a hard pill to swallow that we continue to abandon everyone else for the sake of our own profit yet knowingly still have the profits to save the world. In reality, Americans do not actually want to change but just say they do. The selfishness surrounding our society is so prevalent that is it at the sake of our future and we are only going to destruct it further as we continue the choices we make.


<br><hr>
 You bring up a good point about how it seems unlikely we will get anywhere with the Green New Deal because of where we are politically at the moment, and how tactical framing plays a huge role in society’s opinion on the Green New Deal. You also say that if we continue to allow the Republican party to win, we will continue to lose and this really resonated with me and I found it empowering. As we know, the media presence of the Green New Deal is negative and doesn’t really go into what the deal can do, rather it just gets relentlessly slandered for being a bad idea. Because we know ideas are misrepresented in the media, we can take it upon ourselves to educate ourselves and those around us to gain a better understanding of what the Green New Deal can actually do. If not the deal itself, we can look into what can come out of it, possibly other law-based proposals or bills that can cause systemic action. As you said, our selfishness will get us nowhere and I believe that if more humans can put the well-being of the Earth and other people first, we can make more profound progress.

The Green New Deal would be a step towards change. Once again the beginning reminded us of who are the causes of climate change as well as what climate change is like. What I really liked was how if we continue and raise the temperature to 2° Celsius, the causes are listed, which have already been extensively highlighted throughout this course. However there are also numbers included and it really puts in perspective how the economy will be affected if we continue. The other part that I really liked was when the Green New Deal was explained and everything that would come out of it was also listed. The greatest part about what would come out was the fact that everyone would be helped. Oppressed communities and people would be the most affected by this change and that was really interesting to hear. Throughout history improvements and changes always affect these communities in negative ways and this idea does not forget about them.
                   <br><br>
The policies and programs that would come out of the Green New Deal honestly seemed too good to be true. From wanting to provide higher education to all to the protection of workers. There is a lot of oppression and the deal does not only focus on the climate but the economic and social problems happening. I know this is just like the first step towards change but the ideas were really interesting and it shows that there are people in congress that are actually taking action. They really do believe that the climate is changing and that we need to do something soon. I do believe that the U.S should help developing countries because we are the ones who have put a substantial amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. 
                   <br><br>
Kens video really highlighted how we need profound cultural change. The comparison between the U.S and Bangladesh really showed how developing countries are affected. The numbers of people who are chronically starving to the number of people who have been killed by disasters really shows how we are privileged not to experience that but also makes me feel so bad at the fact that since I live here I’m part of their suffering. I am contributing to what they are experiencing because all these consumption and just everyday things we do that emit greenhouse gases are what we grew up with. It's really hard to not contribute.

It's certainly a relief to find that people like Alexandria Orcasio Cortez, the sponsor of the bill, are making an effort to make the threat of climate change more present in the house. She provided some new facts that I had suspected but hadn't yet been confirmed, particular regarding the economic impact on the U.S.
                   <br><br>

Ken also notes the extreme wealth inequality between developing nations versus the U.S. and some of those statistics were staggering. While I dont think we should be directly investing to help prop up these nations, what we should absolutely not be doing is raping their nation of it's resources and leaving contaminate residue. They very clearly do not have the infrastructure nor education to properly support the kind of manufacturing some U.S. firms demand, and the result of this is what we saw in the film. In particular, contaminated rivers, poorly built structures, horrible electrical wiring, etc. 
                   <br><br>

Lastly I would like to address the concern brought up so frequently regarding how on earth this would be paid for. The answer is simple really and that's to decrease our military spending, which exceeds many of following highest spending nations combined.

The Green New Deal was our first step in confronting climate change. It provided a broad outline of what must be done to meet net-zero emissions. Unfortunately, it was defeated in the Senate. While it was a good plan, it didn't show how it would be paid for. It's obvious it would cost billions of dollars to upgrade all buildings, create transportation that relied on renewable energy, and force industries to emit less. Will we have to pay more taxes to pay for these projects? How will we upgrade existing buildings to make them more efficient and will the owners have to pay for these upgrades? Is it possible to make legislation forcing companies and industries to invest in renewable energy? I believe we can meet net-zero emissions but we must be willing to go through with it. The American public must be on board if we are to make a Green New Deal.
                   <br><br>


I do not think giving money to other countries would change much. Sure, we can give Bangladesh money, but where would the money go? Will the money go to improving living and working conditions for workers or would it just go in the pockets to the people in charge? We should invest money in companies that treat their workers with respect. Maybe we can pay more for products to make sure workers are paid more. However, we have to start changing things in our country. If we give money to other countries but do not change how we live, then this injustice will continue. I think creating legislation that fights climate change will be more beneficial to the world than giving money to other countries.

What I found really cool about this Green New Deal is that it seriously addresses the issue not only regarding the climate change crisis but also aspects about social, environmental justice and economic/social reforms. And it made me feel like the politician and people who have stronger power are leading people to take actions and facing the issue. 
                   <br><br>
Even if it seems it doesn’t have legal power or it is not like a law, there is something proposed to help bring changes to our society. It is true that not only we need to focus on the reasons behind why climate changes happened,how fast it is happening and the impacts it brought to the environment. But we should also consider what we can do to address the problems and as climate changes also causes economic and social injustice, when we are dealing with climate changes, we are also helping to create a safer, healthier and more secure place to live. 
                   <br><br>
I like many of the ideas proposed in the Green New Deal, e.g the use of more renewable. However, as if we for example cut the use of fossil fuels, many people can loss jobs and affect the whole system of economy and employment, and the distribution of power among people on society, So the good thing about the Green New Deal is it would also consider the impacts it might cause after taking those actions proposed and how to make sure it will bring good changes and promote a better and more equal place to live,e.g. assure job opportunities, food security,etc.  
                   <br><br>
For now it seems like we're still working on the ideas proposed and we have not yet fully achieved everything we have proposed, but it is a really good first step that we should be looking at and follow its steps slowly and I believe we will see some good changes on the climate and social issue one day.

In the reading "The Green New Deal," the writers summarized the current state of some environmental changes and the reasons for these changes. I very much agree with Wahyan Tam. I also think that the greater the ability, the greater the responsibility. As the most advanced country in the world, the United States should use advanced technology and advanced concepts to guide the entire world to the path of environmental protection. However, the United States does have the most wasteful country in the world. This is very unfair to many less developed countries in the world, such as Bangladesh, because the hugeness of the United States has also burdened their lives. So I also agree with Ken's idea that the United States should become a leader to help those less developed countries in the world, and help promote how to use more energy-efficient and clean environmental resources.

Just from reading the Green New Deal on the US Congress website, I thought it was a very succinct yet informative and conclusive read of our current climate crisis. I was super hopeful as I read this, only to go to the “Actions” tab to read that the last action for the resolution was that it was referred to a number of subcommittees on 2/12/2019, a little over a year ago. Maybe someone can respond with what these subcommittees have done, if anything, to enforce or take part in the solutions presented in the Green New Deal, but I was super disappointed to read that the resolution just got passed down the chain. 
                   <br><br>
After watching Ken’s video, I realize as hopeful as the Green New Deal sounds, it could be improved by decentralizing what the U.S. culture sees important. I think it’s a great first step, but as Ken says we need degrowth in the US and uplift growth in other countries. The comparisons with the U.S. v the world globally and the U.S. v Bangladesh illuminates the huge gap between the world’s wealthiest and poorest, and the repercussions of such a system. The video leads me to pose the question: Who has the privilege to be protected from the effects of climate change and also to fight climate change, in terms of wealth, resources, technology, etc.? The U.S. plays a big role in the injustice to our nation and the globe, as it frequently ignores its responsibility to combat climate/environment/social injustice.

It truly is a shame to see that the Green New Deal and most, if not all, policy initiatives promoting environmental justice isn't an a priori issue in Congress. The Green New Deal highlights not only imminent impacts absent prompt action, but also adverse effects that climate change is causing in the status quo. As such, it's heartbreaking to know that the lives of frontline and vulnerable communities aren't being prioritized. 
                   <br><br>


I felt the same way about when Ken noted that the Green New Deal isn't perfect and that an overall change in the consumer culture in the US should be emphasized. As repetitive as it may sound, the more I hear about shifting away from excessive consumption and "infinite" economic growth, the more I envision just how much more the US could utilize its resources and global hegemony to fight the climate crisis rather than turning a blind eye to problems that matter more in the long run.

The Green New Deal lists various issues that deal with climate change and explains what should be done to combat these problems in the United States. It was drafted by Ocasio-Cortez and calls for the United States government to take action against environmental issues such as global warming. It specifically states that “because the United States has historically been responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions, having emitted 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions through 2014, and has a high technological capacity, the United States must take a leading role in reducing emissions through economic transformation.” It also states that environmental issues are tied in with other issues in the US: “climate change, pollution, and environmental destruction have exacerbated systemic racial, regional, social, environmental, and economic injustices by disproportionately affecting indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth.” I think this was a very important inclusion in the Green New Deal because it emphasizes the affects of climate change and the issues we may not immediately recognize as associated with it. Many people focus on the science of climate change and ignore the human impacts when in reality, many marginalized groups of people are greatly affected. It is important to talk about these issues.

For a long time after Trump was elected, I felt as though there was no hope for our country. I had brief knowledge of AOC and her plan to reverse climate change, but I had never taken the time to read it as I thought the actual implication of the plan was a long shot. However, after I read it for this assignment, I felt hope. Hope, for the first time in a super long time.

It's absolutely crazy to me that people are not willing to help make a change about climate change until these changes directly affect them. After reading the top comment about the Woolsey Fire, I was made very upset. These kinds of crises are happening on a regular basis all around the world and it's because of anthropogenic climate change. 

                   <br><br>

AOC is the type of leader that we need. She isn't manipulated by big oil companies and by big corporations in general. She is her own person, able to speak up for what she believes is right. This, in our current political environment, is very rare.

I personally had never taken a look at the contents of the Green New Deal. Going to it, I expected the resolutions proposed to only relate to specifically the climate, and specifically the US. However, I was happy to see that the Green New Deal addresses issues far beyond the surface level concept of Climate Change. It made me feel as though the Green New Deal was. of even more importance thanI originally thought. I like how it states that the U.S. needs to take a leading role, due to the amount of emissions we contribute. (I liked that honesty) It then went on to speak about how we also have to address our own internal problems, ie. wage gaps, poverty, hunger, homelessness, etc. which I also believe to be of great importance. How are we supposed to lead change for the world if we can't even change our own issues? This was then utilized asa concept to tie climate action into addressing these issues, and how both can work together to not only improve the climate, but other problems within the U.S. as well. I feel as though the statements in the New Green Deal were spot on. 
                   <br><br>

Then, watching Ken's video made me think about our involvement in helping other countries well. I believe that in order to truly change the direction which climate change is going, we need to help countries that are most impacted by OUR actions. Hearing about the insane differences in percentages of meat consumed and flights taken left me in awe, and not the good kind. Improving economic relations with Bangladesh could even aid in implementing economies based on sustainable products. Though many will argue that what is happening in these less fortunate countries is not something for the U.S. to worry about, I think it is. We are a major reason that millions of people in Bangladesh go homeless during flooding seasons. Each person in Bangladesh only emits 0.44 tons CO2 per year vs the average U.S. person's 16.4. tons...the difference there boggles my mind. These people are experiencing the repercussions of our actions. Action needs to be taken.

Before this week's reading I had not read through it either. Like mentioned in one of the videos I have just heard about the doubt of its success from republican candidates. Therefore I was also very shocked to see that it did not only relate to the climate. I thought it was great as well to see it did not just focus on the topic of climate change and that it brought up many original ideas. I agree that it was very intriguing to hear that we need to be the leader in this. It makes sense, because we are a leader economically. I was shocked while reading over the deal when I saw it addresses issues such as wage gap, hunger, and homelessness. Like you said, I agree these are incredibly important issues and it is great that they were addressed. I like how they provide answers that fix these issues can happen while fixing our negative cultural lifestyles. 
                   <br><br>

I found the comparisons between US lifestyles and Bangladesh shocking. That 40% of americans are obese while 40% of people in Bangladesh suffer from hunger, starvation or chronic hunger. I agree that the US needs to help other countries in which people are suffering. To add to this, we need to change to renewable energy not only in America but in poor countries who could quickly add to the rates of CO2. I think it is horrible that developed countries who have emitted massive amounts of CO2 believe we are not harming anyone, especially other countries. This is quite opposite, the carbon absorbed by the oceans is causing sea level rise. Especially in Bangladesh like you mentioned. I was horrified to hear that 10,000 square miles of their country gets flooded each year due to sea level rise. This causes many issues, from homelessness to thousands of deaths. This is why we need to act, for the sake of innocent people’s lives.

I completely agree with you both on the aspects of the Green New deal and on how we need to help developing countries. Having never read the Green New Deal before, I was pleasantly surprised with the broad range of issues that it addresses. I think that something like this is absolutely necessary not just for the sake of humanity as a whole, but for the sake of mother nature too. The only thing that I am worried about is the actual implementation of the goals this deal lays out. While it does suggest a wide number of goals, it does not say anything about how exactly these goals will be enforced if this Deal passes. I want to know what the legality of these goals are and to what degree we can hold the government accountable for implementing them. I also agree with you that as the largest polluter and contributor to climate change, it is our responsibility to help developing countries survive, recover, and thrive. Not only because we are the ones responsible for their misery and suffering but because it is a human right to have safety, shelter, clothing, and food, and for the US to live in excess and waste much of what we have and stand idly by while millions suffer is immoral and selfish. Helping people is the right thing to do and the US has more than enough wealth to go around, both within its own borders and beyond.



<br><hr>
I think the answer begins in the US and cannot end there, but instead in helping other countries. Like you mentioned I liked that the Green New Deal mentioned a large range of issues. I agree that this is necessary in order to save our planet, that we will only continue to hurt it if we do not get rules of solutions. I agree that because it is broad it is hard to imagine how the goals will function. With little knowledge on politics myself I find it hard to see how  a very simple deal could step by step create these solutions. But I think the reason why the Green New Deal is to try to avoid conflict as Ken mentioned. Like you mentioned we need to take responsibility for our behaviours and the impact it will have on many places. Especially the impacts that will affect developing countries. I agree we should use our countries wealth to help make a difference.



<br><hr>
I also found it interesting how the Green New Deal states that the US needs to take a leading role, and it was refreshing to see how it acknowledged that the US are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. I think you make a good point about the importance of addressing the States internal problems, because why would you want a country to lead and influence the rest of the world when that country itself doesn't really have it together in the first place. I also think that the US helping other developing countries is necessary and should be taken seriously. Through so many readings and film in this course, it's clear how the United States so easily takes advantage of these developing countries. It would be selfish and cruel to say that they have a choice in responding to these "opportunities" the US presents them with. They don't have a choice! So, it's time the US started reverting all the damage and hurt they've caused to these developing countries. They are people too, and deserve respect and compassion. I agree with Lindsey that safety, shelter, clothing and food are all basic human rights, that apply to everyone, not just the US. If developed countries are able to help developing countries, it would be so immoral for them to just do nothing. I liked how the deal incorporated these social injustice issues, because before this class, it wasn't clear to me how these issues relate. It just makes me so mad that the US contributes so much to this issue and leave developing countries to deal with these negative consequences.



<br><hr>
Yes! As a country we not only need to change the way we run our country for the good of the environment but also to create a lifestyle for other countries to follow. Many people still discuss the idea of the American Dream. So I think it would be really interesting to create this in a way that shows a form of success environmentally. In class we are constantly looking at other cities such as Copenhagen, or other countries like Costa Rica. Not only have these countries made a difference, but they did it with less money and power than the US has. This is why I think we should look at them as hope for us. Then from there we can make a huge change. I think you brought up a really good point that the US takes advantage of many developing countries. Each time we have learned about this I have found it very very sad. That we are benefiting from the poor who are suffering. I like how you said they do not have a choice, they need to make money for basic needs. But we do have a choice and we should choose to become more sustainable with our purchases and through voting. Again we are contributing to many issues as you mentioned for our selfish benefits. Therefore I think we need to change our choices and not only become more sustainable but help the countries who need it.

The green new deal does a great job of summarizing what is happening in our climate culture and what is to develop in our future. For example, if 2°C is gained in our global temperature, there will be mass migration, and 99% of the coral reeves will die. Like many other films, it emphasizes the US contribution as being the most significant of them all. Because we buy things from different countries and contribute to a majority of their contributions as well. I was in rolled in English 23, so I have heard many of these facts, but still this way, it’s me that Most people affected by global have contributed very little to it. We will suffer very little from it. We will all feel the consequences are disappointing that the wealthier population that has caused this isn’t going to hurt the result. But we will all suffer the consequence. From what I learned in the green new deal, I feel that the amount of innovation that we bring to technology is so my note that we should stop innovative other than in the medical field and that we should lower production and have a carbon tax for everyThing produced. Most things are junk like a fan that connects to the bottom of your phone and is run by the battery. A lot of materials labor and time are used for such a dumb item that will be discarded probably within the first week of getting it or immediately. Let us buy quality instead of taking in mass amounts of junk.

The Green New Deal definitely accepts what has been happening all over the world and what we can do to improve the climate crisis issue. The United States accepts the large role to assist in the climate change issue because we contributed the most to the crisis itself. In my eyes, the deal is great in accepting what physical disasters will be present but also the social affects to the poor and people of color will occur. We will all suffer the consequences but at currently the people that are being affected the most are suffering in silence while there are still many people are facing problems. Since 2018, the problems have not just affected the "poor" but many are suffering with hurricanes, and large forest fires. Production can really change our carbon output and we are so innovative in everything so I know for a fact there are climate crisis alternatives. We should lower our consumerist policies but the deal is so powerful if only the United States stays committed but we have a leader that disbanded all real efforts. Parts, even close to home, have already hit 2 degrees Celsius and I really do fear for a lack of change. It has been two years and we are seeing the consequences that Earth is fighting back.

One of the first things I noticed when reading the Green New Deal was that, like Ken and many others have stated, the contents of the actual resolution is pretty intuitive. It lays out the facts of climate change and proposes solutions, and anyone who understands the severity and proximity of the climate crisis should logically support it. However, parts of the resolution (that I personally am all for and understand why it is included) seemed to me a bit of a stretch for people to get behind. I know that the popularity and the "electability" of this resolution should not be the main concern but I can't help but think about the reality of the situation. I think every American should read this resolution, rather than hear about it second-hand from news outlets and the media. I agree that then the vast majority of people are likely to support its contents regarding environmental changes. It even outlines responses to economic concerns many people would have: explicitly stating a goal as "to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers". The loss of employment and profits are accounted for and a solution provided, which is something not many people may know about the Green New Deal. However, the resolution also considers this issue of climate justice (injustice) within the U.S., as it should. 
                   <br><br>



While the resolution is absolutely correct in connecting the success of these system-wide changes with providing higher education for all, in order to make the best use of the human resources of innovation and intelligence we have, this would be a make-or-break moment for a lot of Americans. I do believe that people would read "providing resources, training, and high-quality education, including higher education, to all people of the United States, with a focus on frontline and vulnerable communities" as one of the components of the Green New Deal and withdraw support of it there. We are no longer talking just about environmental cause-and-effect here, but rather the shift of education as a luxury commodity reserved for higher classes to a universal right. Realistically, I just don't think that huge cultural change will happen before we all shift to renewable energy. Another section that seems polarizing to me is: "obtaining the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples for all decisions that affect indigenous peoples and their traditional territories, honoring all treaties and agreements with indigenous peoples, and protecting and enforcing the sovereignty and land rights of indigenous peoples." I personally love and fully support that this was included in the resolution because it is absolutely something our country has failed to do for centuries and acknowledges an abuse of human rights that continues today. For that reason, I think it'll never happen and that Americans reading the resolution will become doubtful of its implementation at this point. The question at the very end of this video nailed this point home for me. 
                   <br><br>



"Should we help Bangladesh when they suffer the consequences of [the climate crisis], and help them because we put most of the CO2 in the atmosphere in the developed world?"

                   <br><br>

The simple answer is yes. We absolutely should take responsibility for the disproportionate amount of emissions we have contributed to this crisis, and help those that are suffering disproportionately for it. However, before we can even consider whether the U.S. will step up to the plate with global climate injustices like this, we have to be realistic about whether our history of and tendency to brush aside human decency and equality within our own country will even allow for green practices to be implemented in our own nation. Will we finally take our indigenous people's lives and rights and voices into account, let alone those of starving people in developing countries across the world, when this is literally how our country was born? Is it possible to get our citizens on board with the Green New Deal with equitable access to higher education as an included component? Something tells me the answer to both is a no.

I found your analysis quite intriguing, though I would hesitate from being so pessimistic. I agree with your premise that most Americans should read this for themselves. Having people understand these notions for themselves, rather than allowing them to be framed into something which they are not is extremely important. Albeit, I do have to disagree with your conclusion. Stating that we cannot move towards a more equitable and fair society seems like a disproportionate statement to the makeup of the populace. We’re a massively multicultural country, and I would presume that, independent of demographic, placing education as a priority for most Americans would not be a problem. In addition, we must remember that people do care about making actions which lead to suffering. While we should be more aware as a whole society, individuals are currently abstracted so far from the people and processes behind what they consume. This abstraction is perhaps one of the most dangerous parts of this crisis.

The more I read, the more impressed I am. I feel that the Green New Deal has adequately tackled the issues regarding climate and systemic injustices in the most appropriate, even exemplary, way. I was thrilled to read about the emphasis on protection of ‘frontline and vulnerable communities,’ including indigenous people and youth as a whole. I was also impressed to see the call to action for high-wage jobs through the protection of the planet. Seeing the acknowledgement of the gender, racial, and overall economic gap was surprising as well. These are all truths I was aware of, but seeing that represented by Congress gave me a glimmer of hope. The call to action for a sustainable food system was also appreciated. I noticed they discuss soil carbon storage—I was unfamiliar with
                   <br><br>
this concept until I took an environmental science class. Seeing science being accounted for is a big deal—particularly in the government, considering how our current president couldn’t care less about the facts.

I would agree that the Green New Deal does a good job at addressing social justice issues. I think that is very important moving forward because without this specification I think already marginalized groups will be further marginalized. I also appreciate that the Green New Deal addresses that these social justice issues are fundamental consequences of the way our system is run. I think the inclusiveness of the plan will help it to be successful as it can garner support from many different sources. The environment movement, like most other issues, has people who will try to champion it by means of exclusion or discrimination. Eco-fascism  has become a new phenomenon that usually targets countries with larger populations (though lower per capita  emissions) or poorer communities within the US. The Green New Deal is essential for preventing eco-fascism and other detrimental ideologies from taking root, and to keep building the environmental movement as one that garners support from diverse backgrounds. 

                   <br><br>

I think that the concept of global climate justice is also very important. The US and other developed countries have exploited developing countries and now flaunt the wealth that fossil fuels have given them. It is hypocritical for developed countries to now restrict developing countries from developing fully due to lack of fossil fuels. Developed countries need to subsidize renewable energy to make sure developing countries achieve their needs in sustainable ways. Simultaneously, developed countries need to shift away from some of  the cultural aspects that have enormously negative impacts on the environment such as: an addiction to fossil fuels in all economic means, high rates of meat consumption, and a focus on capital above all else. If we can remedy this with degrowth while also assisting developing countries to meet their needs, then we can make a major difference for the health of our Earth.

I agree that the Green New Deal does an excellent job of addressing the climate crisis to mostly every detail. It was rewarding to see that there is a bill that is propelling the government to take action before it is too late. Although the bill is one of a kind and an important one, it is going to require more from us. It is a movement that we should follow and hold the government accountable. The US and other countries are the main contributors to the crisis and should be responsible for coming up with the solution. The Green New Deal is a good first step and the next thing to do is make sure we can execute it. The US has a tremendous amount of influence around the world and so be a leader in resolving the solution. The bill mentions ways to decrease CO2 emissions and a proposal to come up with a more sustainable food system. As Sam mentions the bill also states that it can do more than just fight the climate crisis, it can give better health care, safe housing, and economic security. It is up to the people who want to see change to hold the government accountable and see the bill come into fruition.

The first thing that left a strong impression on my mind immediately after reading this archive is actually not about the environmental section, but instead, the protection for a universal right to all the people in the country, including communities which have been specified as “frontline and vulnerable”. This is not just a generic proposal claiming for basic rights in response to climate change, but also, it addresses what should be achieved if the Green New Deal is to be realized. I’m impressed by the comprehensiveness the deal exhibits, and also surprised at the courage and determination of the people who drafted it. Cuz in my previous experiences, a deal is only a deal. People draft it, actively set some rules, call for action, and then…no change at all. Those are not even feasible. But what I see from this literally considers all communities, all situations, and all sectors of our lives when faced with the shift of systematic change and climate crisis. Therefore, rather than ignoring it, I really wanna give it my support.

That part also stood out to me when reading about the Green New Deal. It acknowledges that the climate crisis disproportionately impacts certain people/groups not only in developing countries, but in the US. I think that if it can make it through the government, the Green New Deal would make a noticeable amount of change, but it is hard to be optimistic when climate actions are repeatedly shut down by the senate and president. Hopefully, the next election will provide us with more politicians who support it and will fight for the solutions proposed in this reading.

The Green New Deal is a great outline for the first steps that the United States needs take in order to combat the climate crisis. It combines the plan for climate change while also turning some of the negative effects into positives. One example is farming. Getting rid of farming companies would obviously lead to a massive loss of jobs. However, contemporary farming is often harmful to both the workers and the environment as it seeks to profit as much as possible instead of being sustainable. The plan advocates for a transition to family farming which would help the people who are under the heel of these massive corporations. I saw a documentary on farming where the workers described how they once owned the farm but where taken over by a large corporation that then forced them to use inhumane practices on their livestock. The corporations also tried to keep the workers in continuous debt so that they would have no other choice but to work for them. The Green New Deal proposition of family farmers would thus both help the cause against climate change and a group of people who are typically staunch Republicans.

I think it is important to primarily understand what the term Green New Deal is. The term “New Deal” goes back to when President Franklin D. Roosevelt created a plan in response to the Great Depression which was a time where millions of Americans were left jobless and homeless. The Green New Deal is the set of environmental reforms that places responsibility on the Federal Government to secure a sustainable future for the country. This proposed package of plans entails goals that needs focus such as to invest in the infrastructure and industry of the United States to sustainably meet the challenges of the 21st century. Ken then goes to detail the present environmental situation and how countries like Bangladesh is suffering environmental consequences despite being a low contributor to carbon emissions. In fact, he asks the question if the U.S. should extend assistance as one of the top carbon contributors. 
                   <br><br>

The answer is yes and this is not only to help build better relations with countries, but also makes the Earth a place for future generations to live in. I feel like the world globally has been in the mindset of selfish contributions following a materialistic culture. To clarify, countries have been in general living life to benefit their own countries whether it is in war or financial purposes. This makes me insecurely doubt if people especially those in political power will ever come together to acknowledge the fact that environmental awareness should be a united effort.

If the Green New Deal is passed, it is definitely something that will be taught to our children as a point of significant change in our society.  It calls for many changes, which can only be achieved by completely restructuring how our society works.  I’m glad that the GND addresses different socioeconomic groups, such as farmers and businessmen.  I also like how it lists out how climate change is harming the environment in the present and the future, and all the things that need to be done to slow down its destruction.  I believe that the GND will bring many positive changes for the future of the US.

I believe that the Green New Deal is an important and very needed resolution to take steps towards protecting the Earth. By the US trying to pursue a New Deal, it may show other countries that they should also do the same and consider moving away from methods that produce so many enviromental problems. Now that the government is also aware that climate change is very real, there can be an increased pressure of educating the public of the proper data regarding climate change, and not hoax information. Also, since we do produce the some of the majority of emissions, it is our responsibility to take action and pay for our crime to the Earth. In the long run the deal would really be benefiting the youth of America and the future of our lives, and i believe that is really important. I like that it employed many different solutions.

I think the “green new deal” is a really good resolution for the environment in such great country like the United States. It shows that in developed country like the United States, the government has already realize that seriousness of climate crisis, and they really started to do something to help change the situation, because these developed countries emits a lot of Carbon Dioxide and other green house gases and they are able to actually do something. This is a pretty good starting, but if all these can be really implemented is the most important thing. Only having these resolutions is not good enough, unless it is implemented immediately.
                   <br><br>

  Regarding the issue of climate injustice in the world, I think that it will be a problem that cannot be avoid, because the power and ability of each country can be significantly different. I think developed countries should try to do some things to help them. These developed countries are truly the major emitters of Green House Gases instead of the countries like Bangladesh. People in Bangladesh just consider about how to live and what to live, they do not have the ability to protect the environment now. Moreover,  the earth is everyone’s earth, all the people who have the ability should help protect it. Thus, the developed countries should help them.

I agree, the "Green New Deal" is a good resolution that also hits a variety of topics past CO2 emissions. It includes the widespread effects of climate change and how all aspects of society are affecting this situation. I was impressed about how informed and proactive this document was and was very surprised by how many different things were mentioned. I also agree that climate injustice cannot be completely avoided, but it can be curbed. Developed countries are hereafter obligated to pave the way for climate change and justice. Undeveloped and poorer countries are forced to follow the whims of wealthier countries and so it is up to the ones with power to pave the way for drastic change. This is indeed everyone's Earth and individuals should not be reaping the consequences of other's actions. Every single individual should have the power to protect their well being and the well being of the planet.


<br><hr>
I totally agree with your idea that everyone should have the power to protect the Earth. Just as we learn learn in this course, we can do many small thing to help protect the earth. However, the problem is that not everyone is as lucky as we are to have the fortune to access the truth of climate crisis to realize the situation and know what we should actually do to change the situation, so the first step is to inform more people these information we get

Being from Chico, the statistics posed by Ken in the video about how expensive it is to put down a fire really took me aback. When the Camp Fire was happening last year, it was one of the scariest times for everyone living in Butte County, and I spent everyday checking for updates from my parents to see if they had to evacuate or if my house was still even there. However, in all the time I spent worrying, it never crossed my mind that we had to pay for that fire to be put down. I knew the reparations and relocations of people would cost millions of dollars, being that Paradise had to be completely rebuilt, but for some reason I had this idea that the rest was covered. I don’t know why I didn’t acknowledge this but still. With that, Paradise is not a wealthy area, at all. Probably lower middle class with a few exceptions, so the fact that it probably cost $16.5 BILLION dollars to put down the Camp Fire in comparison to the Thomas Fire which was less than $2.2 billion and the Woolsey Fire at $6 billion is rattling. In comparison to those areas, Butte County cannot afford that damage at all. However, with this all being said, even these areas that aren’t as affluent in the United States STILL have the resources and funding that places like Bangladesh or other developing countries could not dream of. To imagine not having my childhood home, my animals, my favorite places in my hometown still standing is absolutely devastating and being a privileged American the idea that this happens every day to countries such as these is mind-blowing. 
                    <br><br>
In regards to the Green New Deal, I find it a wonderful idea. I honestly don’t find it very radical at all. I feel as if it has acknowledged all the systematic problems that the United States has created in relation to the climate crisis whilst posing realistic goals for the government to pursue. Yes, it demands a complete restructuring of our economic system, being that we have to get rid of all natural gas/fossil fuel emissions, which is a difficult task to do, however, the aspect of job security and universal healthcare that is promised within the document is extremely positive and wonderful that it was even taken into account when writing this. I see it as a good beginning for the change we need in our country.

It is unjust that the average American eats 265 lb of meat per year, where in Bangladesh the average person eats FOUR pounds per year. 40,000,000 Bangladeshi people are starving, which accounts for approximately 25% of their population, while in America only about 12% of Americans are food insecure. With air travel, it is even crazier. The average American flies 2.5 flights per year. While in Bangladesh, just one in every fifty-five citizens fly per year. The fact that Bangladesh is one of the countries hit hardest by the climate crisis, when they are one of the least CO2 emitting countries on Earth, that is extremely environmentally unjust. Moving to the Green New Deal, I support this resolution 100%. I have been a fan of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez since before she won her Democratic primary. I am so proud of how far she has come. She is a real inspiration to me and my generation, and I would love to see her run for President in 2024 or 2028 (after Bernie's Presidency, of course!) Her Green New Deal focuses in on key points we as a developed country need to address: affordable housing, universal healthcare, achieving net-zero co2 emissions, and using sustainable energy sources. Ocasio-Cortez, along with Senator Bernie Sanders have really sparked a movement on the left in this country-- a much needed voice in our times. With people like her, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Pramila Jayapal, Ayanna Pressley, Ro Khanna, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang, we do have a bright future ahead of us.

It’s crazy to think we consume that much meat per year but it’s even crazier to think that we produce even more than what we are capable of consuming. I think a big problem lies in the portion size that’s being served in restaurants and even when we cook our own meals. Whenever we go out to eat as a group, I always think it’s a better idea to order as you go rather than ordering more food than what the table can eat. This way not only will it save you money, it will also prevent food waste from happening. Even though the US has a lower percentage of people who experience food insecurity, that number can be totally prevented if we budget our resource distribution accordingly. Wealthier communities are usually the ones that are throwing food away. Instead of doing that we could donate the food to these other less fortunate communities. I think the city of Santa Barbara does a great job with redistributing groceries that are about to become expired. I used to volunteer at PATH, which is a homeless shelter downtown where we serve food to the homeless population here. We get a lot of donations such as pre-packaged salads from Trader Joe’s or like other types of packaged produce where we can just hand out to the homeless people. I think this is a great alternative of letting food go to waste where they can serve at least a purpose and keep people from starvation.

This video really humbled me. So often I think about my first world problems like how hard my classes are and how busy I am, when in reality I'm blessed to afford a college education and be able to work in safe conditions to have my standard of living high. I see no argument that would sufficiently rebuttal against the Green New Deal. Human suffering happens across the planet every second of every day. I can't even imagine what it would be like to be born into a third world country. If Americans have to sacrifice some of their riches to help combat climate justice, then so be it. We got wealthy from making other suffer, so forking up a little bit of the pie is the least amount of compensation we should do. Thank you for pointing out some politicians you favor, as they will be key in enacting this legislation.

It is astonishing how as a country, we are so inconsiderate to underdeveloped countries. It’s really sick. Before taking this class I didnt realize how icky our culture is. Like you emphasized, in the U.S, the average person eats 265 pounds of meat a year. A YEAR. That has to mean that we eat meat almost all three meals a day seven days a week. Personally, I think it’s disgusting. Eating a steak at IHOP at 8am? No thanks. The people in Bangladesh are starving. They only see 4 pounds of meat a year. BIG DIFFERENCE. How is it possible that we, the United States brand ourselves as the leader of the free world when we are doing nothing to help other countries achieve the same thing. Why is it that a power struggle always has to interfere with humanity and end up leaving the less fortunate to bear the gravest consequences. 
                    <br><br>

Same thing with flying, only 1 in 55 people ever travel by plane per year in Bangladesh. Here, it’s like we do it for sport. We see celebrities pick each other up in their private jets making it seem that it is their only method of transportation and wouldn’t settle for anything less. What broke my heart the most was the example Ken used about the Thomas Fire. If that would’ve happened in Bangladesh, those people would’ve been done for. Why are they suffering for the things we, the leaders of the free world, have done? While I agree with you that the new generation of leftists are instrumental in saving our planet, they alone are not enough. It’s about getting everyone on the same side, humanity’s side. Climate change will affect everyone on both spectrums, progressives alone cant save the entire world.

I agree with Tyler in the fact that the United States is largely to blame for much of the social, environmental, and climate injustice that negatively impacts Bangladesh. The climate justice problem is felt worldwide, with developing countries most vulnerable to its impact. If our country is responsible for ¼ of greenhouse gas emissions, we must then pay more foreign aid to the countries that have to deal with our poor lifestyle choices and consumer culture. Therefore, I too believe that the Green New Deal must be enacted, for it is our nation’s best hope to combat these issues. I stand with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal fully; however, I wonder how the government plans to successfully tackle big claims like, “ensuring a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by domestic or international monopolies”. On the bright side, this would be completely ideal, but it seems hard to control transnational corporations who do not claim to have a single “home” country which gives them extra liberties. Additionally, it will be hard to sway consumers away from buying products by international monopolies via the government, as it is more of a cultural change. That being said, although the Green New Deal focuses largely on the U.S. economy, it also pushes society to make cultural changes, which is frowned upon throughout the general public when inflicted by the government.

Ken’s point about Bangladesh’s meat consumption is a little shocking. I wasn’t really aware of the magnitude that we eat meat is that much more than that of other countries. I find it a lot easier to conceptualize the fact that we fly at 14,000 times more frequency than Bangladesh citizens. However, in many ways meat feels ubiquitous in American culture. I looked into it, and Bangladesh isn’t even a religiously vegetarian country like some parts of India. Flooding is an issue I am somewhat cognizant to. My grandparents' home in south India floods just about every monsoon season. I can only imagine how much worse it would be for the poorer regions of Bangladesh. As a trading partner, and as an economic powerhouse, we absolutely have the duty to do better by countries like Bangladesh.

I completely agree with your opinion that we need to do better by Bangladesh and other countries. This video from Ken made it even clearer to me the degree to which the United States is responsible for the climate crisis, while others must pay the highest costs. While it makes sense for the Green New Deal to focus on the US, as it is a proposal for action just within our country, I believe a plan for wealthy and developed countries to assist developing nations like Bangladesh through the climate crisis is absolutely vital. We cannot expect other countries to bypass the centuries of innovation, resource consumption, and slow improvement that the US has gone through and skip straight to sustainable practices when, to this day, we can’t figure out how to live sustainably ourselves. A more comprehensive and international plan to address climate change should include ample aid, in whatever form the receiving countries deem that aid should come in, from the US and other powerful countries to those who rightfully deserve it.

After reading “The Green New Deal,” I have a deeper understanding of what the proposal aims to accomplish. The proposal recognizes that humans are main cause for observable climate change, resulting in wildfires, rising sea levels, and droughts. It predicts that an increase 2 degree Celsius would impact mass migrations, loss in economic output, and destruction and calls for net-zero global emissions by 2050. The goal of the deal is to end use of fossil fuels while creating jobs for the renewable energy sector.
                     <br><br>

The United States has long been regarded as a leader, a country that other countries should strive to be. However, regarding climate change, the United States is failing. As the US has contributed to 2/3 of the global emissions, it is the country’s responsibility to mitigate the climate crisis. The United States owes it to other countries to lead this pursuit because if not the United States, then who? As Ken mentioned, the United States needs to go under degrowth, which will be a cultural change more so than a technological change. 40 million people in Bangladesh are experiencing starvation, yet the United States consumes 6600% more meat. If the United States were able to decrease (or cease) the consumption of meat, more land could be used to grow plant-based foods, which would increase the amount of food produced, which then could be used to feed those who’re suffering. As the US has affected people thousands of miles away, it is our responsibility to recognize our role in the matter and act to mitigate the climate crisis.

I completely agree with your understanding of this reading and the current situation in the United States. "The Green New Deal" didn't come as a surprise to me. It just emphasized how bad the environment is now. It has become an unavoidable fact that a lot of terrible human behaviors lead to sea level rise, drought, tsunami and other major problems. In the previous lectures, the professor mentioned that the majority of scientists advocated people to control the temperature rise to about two degrees. Although it seems like a very small change, we ignore the efforts and costs that human beings have to pay for it. Not only do factories that rely on heavy industry need to be shut down, but the number of vehicles also needs to be greatly reduced. Industry, life, transportation and other aspects will be affected to varying degrees.
                     <br><br>


In my opinion, environmental protection is a very unfair thing. Many countries with rapid development and high international status have much higher carbon emissions than other countries with slow development and poverty. However, people in backward countries often suffer more from the impact of the environment. The tsunami destroyed their homes, the drought left them without enough food, and extreme weather brought them all kinds of diseases. Rich countries should make more efforts for environmental protection and devote more time and energy to control global carbon emissions.


<br><hr>
I also feel like I now have a deeper understanding of the political and institutional changes that society needs to implement in order to combat climate change. The deal first makes clear that anthropogenic climate change is real, and will result in a plethora of irreversible natural disasters such wildfires, coral reef loss, and deadly heat. Additionally, the deal emphasized the impact that climate change will have directly on humans, such as major economic devastation, mass migration and damage to public infrastructure. As this is a human-caused issue, it calls for human solutions, many of which surprisingly center around cultural and socio-political shifts in the way we conduct society. One of the solutions brought forth by the deal is that we need to counteract systemic injustices, by creating jobs and providing “prosperity and economic security” to developing countries around the globe. The article explains how the Green New Deal will bring about a better future for everyone on the planet, while implementing a more sustainable way of life.  One of the main arguments to support this outcome, is that indeed the US needs to go through a period of degrowth, while developing countries are given the opportunity to develop, using renewable energy,  and catch up to the US, so that they will be in an economic position where they can take climate change more into consideration. As Ken has reiterated throughout this course, the poorest countries are facing the worst consequence from global climate change, while the US alone is responsible for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions and many developing countries are only responsible for a fraction of emissions. It is the responsibility of the US as a global leader to ensure that developing countries are given enough room for economic growth to combat climate change. The only way that this room for growth can be created is if the US economy stagnates and reduces emissions drastically.

I agree with you that reading the actual plan made me understand their aims better, which of course is expected. I think if more people took the time to read it, they would be able to see that although it is a big step, it is not reckless or disruptive like it's been called. The issue is getting people to actually read it on their own instead of just accepting what they hear about it in the news.
                     <br><br>

The part where it comments on the 2 degree limit also stood out to me... the big goal that everyone agreed on is no longer good enough. Even if we stay under that limit, (which it doesn't seem like we will due to our lack of change as a whole), we will still be facing some of the horrible consequences. The aim of this deal is to minimize those consequences. It cannot promise to avoid all of it, because we are too far into it for that. However, it does promise that if we follow the plan laid out, future generations will have food, clean air, and a sustainable environment, all of which they have the right to but are put at risk from our actions. Unfortunately, people today often do not consider future generations, they just focus on how much money mitigating will cost and job loss and lifestyle changes. However the second part of the promise is for everyone to have a public job and universal healthcare. If we are supported in that way, we must support the future generations and be okay with some lifestyle changes, in order to make sure they have a livable home in the future. Because the US has done so much harm, we must take up this Green New Deal, or at least something similar, in order to try to make up for all the damage we have done to innocent lives, now and in the future.



<br><hr>
Yes, I feel the same way as you did. The “Green New Deal” recognized that human is the principal cause of climate change and imbalanced carbon emissions. The deal clearly analyzes the consequences of global warming at or above 2 degrees: mass migration, 99% death of coral reefs, and severe wildfires, etc. The most staggering consequences for me is the death of coral reefs, because I learned that coral reefs not only support micro lives living in the sea, but also human largely depend on coral reefs. In fact, every life in the ecosystem chain is essential. 
                     <br><br>
Further from the Green New Deal, I catch up critical phrases like social justices and climate justices. As professor Ken introduces, “Americans consume over 6600 pon of meat more than people in Bangladesh and 14400 tons of carbon pollution than people who can take flights in Bangladesh.” Fast fashions, multiple types of food, and convenient flights that Americans enjoy including Europeans and Asians who are affordable to pay produce too much carbon into the atmosphere. Poor people in the third world who want opportunities to develop allow factories to root on their lands. They work for the factories and the factories pollute their homeland as well. We enjoy, while they bear sufferings. All in all, I think that people in more developed countries need to change into a green life and people in less developed countries can choose a green way to develop. And we who produce large parts of carbon should take the responsibility to help them and save the Earth.

Though the topic of climate change had been no stranger to me prior to this class, this proposition, the Green New Deal had no significance to me before this class. Yes, I had heard of it mentioned here and there but did I know what it was or what it stood for? No. Absolutely not. Evidently, what is lacking here is education. The public is being bombarded with tweets from our very own president, suggesting that the Green New Deal will strip them of things they value, we are being bombarded by the news channels that seem to capitalize on the politic of this argument, but hardly educated on the focus of what the Green New Deal is actually trying to achieve. 

                     <br><br>

What is most compelling to me is that the United States is one of the world's leading contributors to climate crisis yet we hardly suffer the consequences of the devastation that the climate crisis is bringing to our homeland simply because we have the wealth to overcome. On the other hand, like you explained, the developing nations have contributed little to no harm to our earth's atmosphere, yet they will be the ones suffering from our ignorance. This is mind-boggling to me because I believe that they have no right to be suffering the effects, when we are the ones responsible. After all, we have the "luxury" of technology and medicine that can protect us from suffering from self-induced disease and self-induced global warming while the people living in developing countries will have little to no ways to fend for themselves due to the fact that many are living in poverty. That to me is unjust. Unhuman. I believe that we owe them the recourses they need to live comfortably but also sustainably. It is a problem that not only the previous generation engineered but also mine, and for that, I feel that the United states and other leading contributors to climate change owe  developing nations an apology and a solution.

I think that most of the cultural changes that have to take place mainly pertain to first world countries like the United States, so proposed resolutions like the Green New Deal -- which is primarily focused on the U.S. economy --  is an important step in the right direction to fighting the climate crisis. However, I believe that it is imperative to consider the social, economic and environmental justice of other, underdeveloped countries as well. The Rana Plaza Disaster in Bangladesh occurred largely in part due to the America's culture of mass consumption -- more specifically, our culture of waste and fast fashion. Therefore, it is necessary that we take responsibility and make sure that there are firm environmental and social policies that will prevent Bangladesh and other countries from not only destroying the planet but also killing their own people without consequence. So although I am happy to see resolutions proposed like the Green New Deal, I don't think it is enough to be content with ourselves since it mainly pertains to the United States. The climate crisis is a global issue, and involves people from all over the world. If we were to fight against it, we would have to reconsider our trades and economic relationships with countries like Bangladesh so that we don't put their citizens in dangerous, inhumane working conditions.

Although we really should be helping poorer countries transition to renewables and help to get them out of the environmental catastrophe we created, it is simply not going to happen. As much as I would like for that to happen, we are already having a hard time of adjusting ourselves, with over half of our population refusing to spend additional money to save our environment, even when they know the consequences. Now, imagine that we do transition entirely to a sustainable lifestyle. Its still the same people. They may act more environmentally friendly, but their capitalist greed is still there. They aren't all of the sudden going to turn benevolent and help out other countries. Rather, the outcome I foresee in the long-shot that we somehow do transition our entire society by 2050, is that we are going to force an international agreement down these poor, powerless countries' throats. We would ban fossil fuels and cattle farms, and back it up not with incentives but with our military; just like we have always done.

                     <br><br>

Essentially, since these countries have no other ways or resources to rise above poverty without fossil fuels, we will either force them to remain third world countries perpetually or go to war with them if they refuse. As cynical as it sounds, I think that once we do our green transition, the climate wars that will follow will not just be over climate migrations but us policing the use of land and fossil fuels. Poor countries like the middle east and some African countries, got screwed over by us, are being screwed and will perpetually continue to decline in their economic and social status.

In the Green New Deal, if the global temperature rises at or above two degrees Celsius, there will be plenty of climate disasters appear, such as wildfire in the US will be about two times as much as 2019, and more than 350 million of people will experience the unendurable heat in 2050. As a result, with the promise which Green New Deal also provides to the citizens, they need to make their lifestyle more sustainable. After watching Ken’s lecture, I was shocked that although the consequences of the climate crisis will be bear together by the people all around the world, some poor countries such as Bangladesh will suffer more than developed countries like America. This seems pretty ironic to me for the reason that to become wealthy and developed, America emitted almost a quarter of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However, the people who are influenced by the catastrophes which global warming brings will be the one that lives in the countries like Bangladesh, which contributed few carbon dioxides into the atmosphere and less developed for the same reason. This can be considered as “social injustice” as Ken mentions in his video.
                        <br><br>
     Right now, the meat consumptions per capita in Bangladesh are only four pounds per year, while American eat 6600% more than them. For the number of people who taking flights and owning cars, American is 14000% and 21000% more than the people who live in Bangladesh. More than this, some developed countries also built their factories in poor places, like Bangladesh, which leaves the people there no other choice but to take the job with awful working conditions, regardless of their local environment. For all the reasons above, I think it is essential for developed countries like the United States to help the less developed countries with the issue of the climate crisis. To address the climate crisis effectively, all the people around the world ought to work collectively.

It was kind of surreal reading the green new deal and feeling like I was reading into the future. Those numbers were so big, they didn’t look real in the first place. 500,000,000,000 dollars lost by 2100 in the United States, 99% of the coral reefs gone, hundreds of millions of people exposed to deadly heat stress by 2050. All this happens with only a mere global climate rise of 2 degrees Celsius. We are basically there already almost there thanks to our own actions. I liked that this is the first point addressed in the green new deal, stating that human activity is the biggest factor to blame for all the horrendous things that are happening. 
                        <br><br>
I am not much into politics, but I was rather surprised and intrigued while reading the various points Ocasio Cortez makes throughout this document. Yes, there are many problems and disasters that are being face; but the green new deal also proposes so many goals, ideas, and projects that will overall help the climate and the people on this planet.

My favorite part about the Green New Deal is that it is written so simply and plainly, it is meant for the average person to read it.  After reading it, and taking all of Ken's points into consideration, I struggle to find a reason why anyone wouldn't supportive of it. We are so privileged in the US that we have the luxury of debating whether or not climate change is something we have to worry about, while there are other parts of the world that are already feeling the effects more severely than we are.  I also loved that the GND brought up that first and foremost, climate change is brought about principally by human activity.  It leaves no room for interpretation and everything after that point just builds upon it.

I was familiar with the Green New Deal prior to this week's reading. However, I have been able to become more informed about what exactly it consists of. I think it is extremely true that the U.S. is a "model" country. We are one of the leading nations in the world that emits some of the highest greenhouse gases. It is completely up to us to take control of our actions and make sure that the change begins with us. Likewise, it is important that everyone is as informed as possible. The Green New Deal outlines exactly what we should do given the current consequences. Change begins within us all and it is important that young people take political action as well. Just like I was familiar with the Green New Deal but did not know exactly what it contained, other people too should become just as familiar with it. 
                        <br><br>
Ken's reference to the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars was used to treat the Thomas fire shocked me immensely. I knew just how much money was needed to repair damages after, but I did not think much about the equipment required in order to treat the fire itself. It is of upmost importance that we pay attention to our planet and take care of it to prevent disasters like this from happening again as well as mitigate the effects of it.

I'm on the same boat as you where I knew some parts of the Green New Deal, but not all of it. Although something that stood out for me was the fact that environmental racism and injustice were brought up as people tend to acknowledge the bad effects of climate change, but not how it disproportionally affects people of color in low-income communities. And it is crazy how we are part of a nation who is seen as a leader, yet cannot lead the world to a greener and safer place. We are not a cohesive, well-functioning unit, it's more of all men for themselves which is WACK. Considering how the emissions differ drastically in Bangladesh and the United States is astonishing, but not shocking as the US has an immensely huge consumer culture. But when thinking about the Thomas fire and how that already does so much damage by doing what fires do, it also costs a financial burden and amasses more debt, because money like that is just sitting around, like no one just plans for a fire to happen, it's abrupt and crazy.

<p>
I appreciate how the Green New Deal identifies the United States huge role in creating the climate crisis through statements such as "...because the United States has historically been responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions... the United States must take a leading role in reducing emissions through economic transformation." Due to our large contribution of emissions, 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, we must be responsible to fix this issue. Not only do we owe it to ourselves to lead this transformation, but we owe it to all the other countries that are negatively effected by the climate crisis, often which face worse conditions than we have here in the U.S. In terms of compassion, the United States is one of the only countries who can help other countries in tackling the climate crisis due to our wealth. As Ken said in the video, how many other countries could afford to tackle extreme weather like we did in the Thomas fire. Undoubtedly the Green New Deal calls for a lot of money to be invested into environmentally friendly practices, this rises concern for me. I'm afraid the U.S. won't view the climate crisis as a priority and won't invest the necessary amount of money. Otherwise, I think the Green New Deal has few flaws and is set up clearly in a way that everyone who reads it will understand the message.

The United States needs to fix the emission problems, and I was amazed by the same statement from the Green New Deal as you did. The United States, indeed, is responsible for reducing the emission, but the rest of the world should take a step together as well; due to that Europe and Russia also contribute a large amount of the emissions. As the Pais Agreement, that the developed countries promised to decrease the temperature together through reducing emissions and other aspects. I share the same concerns as you did, because as I read through the Green New Deal which I noticed that it did not just about improving the environment. The Green New Deal definitely requires a large number of funds from the government in order to implement it. Because the Green New Deal also asks the U.S government to create more high-wage jobs and better healthcare for people. Seemingly, those deals do not relate to the climate crisis directly. So, I think from the Green New Deal that it won't be a priority for the politicians. But natural disasters do decline the economy, I believe that either the government or people do not want to see an economy that is decreasing.

The Green New Deal is a set of proposed legislations and policies which aims to solve the problems bring by climate change and overfast economic development. In this Green Deal, it does not only come up with the climate crisis and approaches, but also pay attention to the social problems like wage stagnation, income inequality, and health security. I really agree to one concept in Ken’s video that people should make culture changes response to climate crisis. The change should be thoroughly. Just like the regulations in the deal that developing 100% power demand through clean, renewable, zero-emission resource, and creating good, high-wage jobs for more people. These regulations are a long process and a thorough change. We cannot ignore them because they are hard to accomplish. Besides, not merely focusing on domestic climate problems, the deal also includes resolutions for international and global conditions. Since the developed countries like US account for huge amount of greenhouse gas emission in global. Nevertheless, the consequences from climate change are mostly borne by developing countries. In the deal, US is asked to take the leading role to promote international exchange and help other countries to achieve the green new deal. I think it is more reasonable. 
                        <br><br>
I hope that the green new deal can be more widely spread in worldwide. But the most important is that US can firstly take this step to put the deal into actual use. US has huge influences on the climate change, and I hope it can be good influence now. Net-zero emission, more clean and eco-friendly public transit, safe food and water, and healthy economy are all things need to be considered. To make the deal become real, we need to make more people know about it, and vote for it. That’s the thing we can do as individuals.

As one of the richest and most powerful countries in the world, I believe that the U.S. does have a responsibility to help other countries like Bangladesh and the rest of the world. The responsibility of the Rana Plaza disaster should fall mostly on the U.S., after all, it was U.S. fashion companies that pushed the factory owners to lower the safety standards in order to maintain cheap labor. If more care had been put into the safety of those workers' lives, they would still be here today.
                        <br><br>
There should also be environmental safety laws in place in order to keep factories from dumping toxic waste wherever they want. These laws would not only be good environmentally but also morally. We, as the U.S. cannot look at a poorer country and say "Let's exploit them. We can ruin their land and their people, while we live in our safe, developed, clean country." It is not fair or morally right.
                        <br><br>
Taking responsibility for the people and environment of other places is sure to be costly, but that is also a benefit. The more expensive something is, the fewer people will buy it, and the less waste of resources we will have on our planet.
                        <br><br>


The Green New Deal is an ideal solution to a less-than-ideal problem. It would be amazing to have these changes implemented for the well being of the planet and American citizens, especially the middle class. However, as great as this idea sounds, it's unlikely to make much progress given the current state of our government. We, the American people, need to vote to get the representatives that will make change happen into office. If we can do that, maybe we can see a better future.

I agree with you on a lot of what you said, although there is one point that I think should be made as well.  What I agree with you on is that the U.S. absolutely has to take a large amount of the responsibility for these climate disasters happening to other more impoverished countries.  Although it may not be exclusively our consumer culture that forced so many poorer nations and people into environmentally disastrous and unsafe working conditions, many other first world countries contributing to this problem extensively, we are undoubtedly the principal consumerist nation and therefore the one that needs to change the most.  If we as one of the the largest, most environmentally unconsciousness, and consumerist nations take on the responsibility for the carbon emissions of much poorer countries manufacturing our goods, other nations are sure to follow.  And by leading through example, trying to create better paying jobs in environmentally safe industries like the green new deal is attempting to do, we will hopefully make it so working class people in poorer countries like Bangladesh can find jobs that are good for them and our environment.  The one point that I wanted to make that differs from your comment a little was that the Rana Plaza  disaster should fall mostly on the U.S.  While we should definitely legislate that companies wanting to business in the U.S. should be unable to exploit working conditions such as the ones that caused the disaster, it was ultimately the local government that allowed those conditions to be in place at all.  The protests and riots that happened after the disaster are evidence enough of that, how angry the people were that the government had turned such a blind eye to the horrendous workplace environments occurring.  Is the U.S. guilt free?  Absolutely not, as it was our consumerism that fueled the desire for the cheapest working conditions, but direct blame for tragedies such as the Rana Plaza disaster needs to fall on the greedy politicians who sell out their working class into even deeper poverty just for money from the fashion industry.



<br><hr>
I think it is safe to say that most environmental disasters, although without satisfying evidence, can be linked back to the United States. The U.S. is a global superpower and super-villain simultaneously. It has done marvelous things for the world and has also caused most of its destruction- I truly believe it is safe to admit that. The United States is glorified-mainly by itself. But it has no reason to because it is actually a terrible country. We may have freedom-more than any other country in the world. But at the cost of sincere concern for humanity. The United States only cares about itself. And by "the United States" I mean politicians, the top 1%, ignorant citizens, and anyone within this country who has direct influence on this country's priorities. How does this relate to any of the videos? All we read, watch, and hear about is how the United States is the root of climate change and so many other global issues. There is no existing justification because you can't justify greed or non-action. You saw it yourself. Multiple times. Exxon and American politicians knew since the 70's. The U.S. is capable of solving this problem but it won't until life becomes more valuable than money. So fuck American patriotism. There's nothing to be patriotic about. This country is hiding too much.

After reading the Green New Deal and watching Ken’s video introducing it, I honestly felt a little worried about all the changes that we are supposed to make in order to save our planet. I was worried not because I was scared of how creating new policies and standards would completely change our current lives, but because I am afraid there is too much to do and too little time. The clock is ticking, and we need to move fast. 

                        <br><br>

I completely agree with you that a great deal of responsibility lies in the hands of the U.S. We are, as you stated, one of the richest and most powerful countries in the world, which is all the more reason that we need to be the ones who take action. 

                        <br><br>

The proposed Green New Deal was comforting to read in a way because it demonstrated that there are people in our government who are educated on climate change and what it will bring in our future if we do not take the steps to prevent it from happening. Yet it was also frightening to read what lies ahead if we fail to act, but absolutely necessary in motivating readers to take action. 

                        <br><br>

You’re right when you say that we need to vote for the right representatives and people in power if we want to see a better future and implement the changes the Green New Deal suggests. But at the same time, I am worried that that is not enough. Change is a slow process, especially when concerning a planet of nearly 8 billion people. Is it really possible to reach net-zero global emissions by 2050? Change the way we eat, travel, and consume drastically? Educate enough people so that enough change will actually take place? It’s difficult to be optimistic about all this, but I truly hope we can all come to their senses and make the right decisions about climate change.

In the video, Ken pointed out the climate injustice by comparing the exaggerating data between Bangladesh which represent the developing country and U.S which represent the developed country. I never have intuitive understanding of how much the developed country contribute to the environmental problem such as CO2 emission and how much developing country suffer from the environmental problem which they are not supposed to until i’ve learned the date given out by Ken in the video. Just like the meat consumption, one of the main factors of CO2 emission, it is actually hard to be a problem in Bangladesh as the per capital meat consumption is 4 pounds per year. But in U.S. people consume 265 pounds per year which have a huge difference from Bangladesh. As for air travel, “per capital air travel in U.S is 14,000 percent greater than in Bangladesh. This is an exaggerating data which is hard for me to imagine. Except for those data, Ken also emphasized the climate injustice. Poor countries like Bangladesh are actually suffering more from environmental problem than developed country like U.S. However, developing countries actually contribute to the environmental problem much less than developed country. Developed countries placed factories in developing countries which will cause harm to the environment in developing country directly. But the productions produced in developed country are enjoyed by people in developed country which is unfair since poor people undertake environmental responsibility that they shouldn’t take. Especially when poor country don’t have developed equipments, enough financial support and medical support to improve their environment. So, government should take some actions to resolve this serious problem and the Green New Deal is an important one.
                        <br><br>
The reading makes the climate problems caused by gas emission we are facing and we will face more clear to me. It shows that the gas emission will cause harm to a country from many different aspects like economics, environmental, social stability of country and communities. However, i feel optimistic after reading the Green New Deal since it clearly shows the purposes of creating the Green New Deal, what actions the governments should exactly take to help with the climate problems and inequality  and what positive consequences will bring after those actions.  Before, i know government will take actions but that’s it. So i actually thought that if government was just giving an empty talk to comfort people but they actually do nothing. But now this reading make me retake the confidence to the government.

It pains me to see how the Cambodian government reacts to the garment workers’ protest in The True Cost, and now similar issue is brought up again. The US has been the main beneficiary of these industries, and if the US doesn’t know how to mitigate these issues, these developing countries certainly won’t know better. Besides the fact that the workers are forced to work in a very harsh condition, the jobs that they are doing aren’t even the jobs that they are supposed to be doing because these jobs bring low economic incentive and more destruction to the environment that would hinder potential future development of this land. 
                           <br><br>
Is America, especially the corporations that have spread this recipe of disaster all over the globe, responsible for the ongoing crisis and injustice? Partially yes, but it wouldn’t say that America should take all the responsibility to reverse the climate change in other countries. I believe that America has a lot more domestic issues that need to be addressed first, particularly these industries that outsource their work overseas need to be regulated. The act of setting an example to the rest of the world could be a huge step forward. As an international student, I think my role is to learn the knowledge here in the US, and bring it back to my home country.

The Green New Deal is a highly detailed plan proposed by AOC that combines Roosevelt’s New Deal proposal with modern-day environmental concerns designed to curb the number of greenhouse gases being released by the US. At the time of its release, the goal was to keep the planet from warming about 2 degrees Celcius, but at this point in time, we have already lost all hope of achieving that. Regardless, this plan still contains highly detailed steps that the US needs to employ moving forward if we are to ever have a chance of combating climate change.

                           <br><br>

The ways in which this is similar to the New Deal while at the same time differing from plans such as Project Drawdown is it includes both the economic and social factors and implications of climate change while also highlighting the economic growth we could achieve if we actively begin combating it. It makes the point that mobilizing now will “create millions of good, high wage jobs in the US and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States”, to “to secure for all people of the United States for generations to come, clean air and water; climate and community resiliency; healthy food; access to nature; and a sustainable environment” and will “promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth”, all three of which were also goals highlighted in the original New Deal. 
                           <br><br>


This plan also illustrates the steps necessary to achieve the goals I listed above. The main takeaways I took from that were we have to emphasize clean production and manufacturing as well as upgrading our technology so that we can eventually release zero emissions. One thing I failed to see mentioned, which is at the forefront of my mind after watching Cowspiracy, is the need to reform the cattle industry. 51% of greenhouse gases emitted are from livestock yet most of the solutions revolved around decreasing production and transportation emissions. In my opinion, it might have been left out because this list poses concrete solutions that can be achieved by the government rather than relying on providing solutions that would require the participation of all Americans, which is, in this case, the cessation of eating meat or at least decreasing consumption a significant amount.

I think the U.S.’s responsibility is a very interesting and confusing topic. Most of the time America deems it okay to intervene in regards to our military, as seen in the many different wars the U.S. has taken part in. We like to think of ourselves as the world leader and one that other countries can follow. Yet for some reason when it comes to environmental issues or literally  anything else besides military intervention, America decides that it isn’t our problem. Countries should feel no obligation in helping with the climate crisis. The problem was clearly created by the most well off countries, especially the U.S.. How are other countries expected to have strict environmental laws if the so-called "world leader" won’t admit to the problem or take responsibility? I feel great sorrow in thinking about the negative effects climate change will have/is having on so many poorer countries and I find it really sad that we can go about our day to day lives with little to no consequences during the present time. Therefore, I do think that it is the U.S.’s responsibility to help other countries considering the problem was mostly from our doing. A huge step we can take is implementing what is outlined in the Green New Deal in order for other  countries to gain motivation.  A key takeaway from the Green New Deal's purpose is to not only combat climate change but create a better culture/society and this thought should be carried over into our interactions with other countries as well.

I had heard of the Green New Deal and followed as AOC introduced it into Congress. At the time, I agreed with her and loved what she was saying, but never actually read the bill. I absolutely agree with the contents of the bill as being what has to be done to fight the climate crisis. I acknowledge that it's radical. I acknowledge that it's idealistic and will be very tough to get done. But these are the types of measures that need to be taken and I am very grateful that they are being introduced now so that people can get used to them. This is the degree of action that needs to be taken in order for the United States to do their part in helping solve the climate crisis, which we did our fair share in creating. I also like that Ken brought up “degrowth”. It is very important that we talk about that as a country as well. The American economy has been growing and strong for decades, and it is taboo to wish for anything but economic growth and stability. I agree that it is nice to be a superpower and have such a solid economy, but what is the point if we are destroying our Earth? We need to change our mindsets and accept that the only way we can fix this is if we check our egos and do what has to be done for the greater good. It is our responsibility and we have to do it now.

I am on the same page as you. When I first heard about the Green New Deal, I hadn’t read the actual resolution, I just heard about the basics of it all and came to the conclusion that I agreed with it. All I needed to know is that it was a push to enact change to fight the climate crisis and I was on board. Reading the entirety of it now, I realize it accounts for a lot more than just addressing the climate. After presenting the alarming facts of how climate change is currently affecting our planet and the projections for the future, it discusses ways in which America can work to limit our carbon footprint by tackling issues such as energy production, infrastructure, and transportation. What I didn’t know about is how the resolution states that this dramatic change will result in people losing their jobs and could lead to environmental injustices in poorer communities. In account for that, the Green New Deal talks about how it will shift the work force and create millions of jobs in new “green” sectors and how to protect the people by providing universal health care and education and training. This is put in place to make sure protecting our planet will not cause further economic inequality. With the Green New Deal, our culture and economy would look very different than it does today, however I believe that this change is necessary in order to mitigate the impending doom of the planet. While a resolution is a step in the right direction, it doesn’t actually do anything but promise that politicians will eventually create policy. We are running out of time, and this upcoming election will be extremely important, as if we have another four years of the current administration, it will be difficult, maybe impossible, to get any climate policy like the Green New Deal passed.

Regarding the Green New Deal itself, it presents a set of systematic resolutions to mitigate the climate crisis based on the level of country. Sadly, due to the effect of tactical framing, many people tend to treat it as a party strategy instead of paying attention to the substance of this deal. It is a tragedy. Facing the coming global catastrophe, politicians are still playing such tricks to gain power.
                           <br><br>
However, now I would like to talk about Ken’s video. In this video, Ken put a lot of comparisons in many aspects between the developed countries and developing ones, in specific, the US and Bangladesh. Many of them shocked me. For example, regarding food/meat consumption, in Bangladesh, only 4 pounds of meat was consumed per capita per year while in the US the number is 265 pounds per capita per year, which means that the Americans consume 66% more than people in Bangladesh. Let's be more intuitive. 40% of people in the United States have obesity, while one in ten people in the world is suffering from chronic hunger daily! The comparisons in terms of car ownership and the number of aircraft rides are also amazing.
                           <br><br>
Just as mentioned in the Green New Deal, the US should and has the responsibility to take the leading rule in reducing emissions. And the Green New Deal is just the first step. Sadly, many people still treat it as to be too impractical. However, I believe it is not a daydream nor a joke. Instead, it may be the last and only chance for us and our future generations to survive.

The statistics that Ken throws out regarding America and Bangladesh are embarrassing. I know that the United States is a developed country and we feel like we absolutely need some of these things, but in reality, we don't. I love my car and the freedom that it comes with, but if I was forced to ride the train home, I could. The only thing that gets tricky with some of this stuff is when we see places in the US that don't support public transportation. I live along a highway in the central valley. Very, very dangerous to bike into town, not to mention that it's about 6 miles. There are car crashes weekly and most of the time the cars swerve into the ditch on the side of the road. Not ideal for riding a bike. My town is also so small that there is no bus at all, other than the school bus. I work in a town about 15 miles away and there is absolutely no way to get there other than driving. If we are going to say let's stop driving cars we need to start putting things in place to replace this before cutting everyone off. 
                           <br><br>
The United States needs to show some initiative and take action. We have the ability to promote change for the rest of the world, especially considering that we basically caused this in the first place.

After reading the Green New Deal, I feel more optimistic about the climate crisis because I believe that this is a feasible and practical solution of staying below 1.5 degrees Celsius and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Even though Green New Deal is not a law or regulation, it advocates the need in the duty of the federal government to act and push toward the climate change based society. In my opinion, if the U.S. government integrates and follows the Green New Deal, there must be an unbelievable success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I like how it includes everyone in the Green New Deal so that the indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, low-income workers, women, elderly, disabilities and youth, etc. are not treated differently from the higher socioeconomic status people within the society. Additionally, this deal also promises higher wages, equality, and transitions for people as this is a down growth in the economy. 

                           <br><br>

Challenges and barriers are what we should overcome, especially the power of the nation is mostly controlled by the rich. We should mobilize our will and desires toward climate to act as a world example. If one of the powerful countries acts, the following will respond too. Besides, I’m furious at how Trump slashed funding to Bangladesh while they suffer from climate change. I think that it is our responsibility to help the developing world go through the hard times caused by the climate crisis, and we should reduce our emissions at the same time to stop exacerbating our planet.

I agree with you that the Green New Deal really brought me a sense of hope for our future and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While I was reading “The Green New Deal,” I liked how this legislation brings to attention many solutions to solving the issues of climate and environmental justice while improving the economy. There were many statistics that I found eye-opening, such as the fact that if global temperatures rose above 2 degrees Celsius, over one trillion dollars of damage would be done to the US coast, there would even be a mass migration, and about 99% of the coral reefs would die. Although these consequences of climate change are very discouraging, I felt that some of the solutions were definitely doable and provided me with a little more hope for the future of the planet, such as switching clean energy, creating more sustainable forms of animal and plant agriculture, and creating new jobs. If the US was to implement these solutions proposed by the Green New Deal, we could reduce emissions and improve the economy. Since the US is the part of the countries that emit over ⅔ of global emissions has the fifth largest economy in the world, I feel like it is our responsibility to take action. Like Ken said, a lot of our issues could have been seen as “first world problems” from the point of view of the outside world. In order to reduce our emissions, we need to enter a period of degrowth and reduce meat consumption. In contrast, developing countries must enter a period of sustainable growth in which they must responsibly and sustainably use more energy to light up and develop villages. The Green New Deal is very important and much needed at this point in order for the US to begin paving the path to ending climate change.

Do we, as America, owe other countries like Bangladesh anything? Do we have a responsibility to watch our output of greenhouse gases so other countries not as fortunate as us won't be destroyed? I think we do. And I don't think it is a choice. Our current president sometimes presents issues from a mindset that revolves around America. When in fact, climate disasters that affect other areas are just the beginning of what we will be experiencing in the future. We all live on the same planet Earth and what affects our neighbors will eventually affect us.
                           <br><br>
Secondly, if we are looking at this from a moral and ethical standpoint, it is only right to care about other human beings. Most religions emphasize this, and if you are not religious you learn empathy from those around you. It is extremely ignorant to disregard the state of other countries and not take responsibility for our part in the destruction of them.
                           <br><br>
Something like the Green New Deal takes responsibility for our wrongdoings in this climate crisis and presents a clear plan of action. The Green New Deal also emphasizes the lower and under class, as well as marginalized folk. This is important, because we need to first figure out how to address climate inequality in our own country before we can begin to understand it in others.

One of the main arguments by Ken Hiltner in this video is that the climate crisis is not mainly an environmental one but also a cultural one. I completely agree with this statement because the reason why many of us have a hard time quitting our consumerist needs is that obtaining material items is seen as one of the keys to happiness in the American Dream. In essence, if we change how our younger generations view consumerism we might be able to convince developed countries to stop utilizing as much energy. Culture is transferred from generation to generation so although it might be too late for us to alter our habits, maybe we should invest more time into making sure our children don't repeat our mistakes. Instead of burning fossil fuels, we should be looking into the solar, wind, or even water-powered energy sources that we already have.

                           <br><br>

To me, the fact that we eat 66 times more meat than the average person in Bangladesh amazes me. 2 in 5 Americans are obese while 40 million people in Bangladesh are starving to death. Tying this back to one of Ken's earlier videos this is why we must fix our cultural issue of wasting food. Markets will throw away even slightly deformed produce (that is still edible) which is extremely unreasonable. Instead, we should be donating more food to the poor in the United States and other countries. We should raise our future children to be mindful of how blessed they are to live in a developed country like the United States where famine is practically no concern.

I am extremely glad that we were assigned The Green New Deal as our reading for this week. Before looking at it, I knew that it was about climate change, but I had no idea exactly what it said about the climate crisis. Reading this gave me hope for the future because it shows me that someone out there is thinking of ways to save our planet, and they are trying to put it in action. There are so many people out there that say they are going to do something about the rising temperatures but end up not following through on their promises.
                           <br><br>
Ken's video was also extremely eye opening because I was able to see exactly how privileged we are in the United States. I am aware of the fact that we are a developed country while Bangladesh is a developing country, but I did not know how substantial the gap really is. To think that 40 million people in Bangladesh are starving right now while a good deal of population the American population is obese is extremely heartbreaking. The fact that only four in one thousand people in Bangladesh own a car shows that we as Americans take what we have for granted.
                           <br><br>
It was upsetting to hear that the Trump administration cut the funds to Bangladesh by two-thirds. We have a great deal to offer in the United States, and I think we can afford to help Bangladesh as much as possible. It is sad to see that we are too greedy to give up items that we probably have extras of. Unfortunately, this also shows me that the United States is not ready to be the leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If we cannot aid someone in their time of need, how can we show the rest of the world that they should follow in our footsteps?

I definitely agree with what you said. After reading The Green New Deal, I felt a bit more hopeful about our future. I was impressed that the article acknowledged what kind of issues the US has caused and takes responsibility for them. I also really liked the fact that several opportunities that can arise from the Green New Deal were mentioned, like creating high-wage jobs and access to economic security. This really showed that there are many benefits to these new legislations that don't just directly involve climate change. They will improve our country's living standards as a whole.
                           <br><br>
I also understand where you are coming from when you mentioned how eye-opening this lecture was to you. It is truly insane to think about how many millions of people are starving all around the world while we have a huge obesity problem in the US and are, at the same time, throwing away enormous amounts of food every day. This reminded me of one of the first things that Ken mentioned in this class - the countries that are the least responsible for climate change will be the ones who suffer the most. While we're over here wasting all this food and over-eating, other people are dying of hunger. As you said, there are so many things that we take for granted that people from other countries only dream of. It is really disappointing how we take those luxuries for granted.
                           <br><br>
I also agree with your statement about the United States not being the most fitting leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There are many countries that are a lot more eco-friendly and conscious of their emissions than we are. We still have a long way to go, but I believe that the Green New Deal is a great step in the right direction.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. The Green New Deal definitely a step in the right direction and can help every single person around the world, even if they do not believe in climate change. There are so many wonderful side effects that could come with implementing The Green New Deal that it is hard to believe some people do not want to. There is no doubt that everything stated in this document can increase the standard of living for the entire world and, still, people say no. I am glad that you brought up Ken’s point about who suffers the most in regard to the climate crisis. It is extremely fitting when thinking about the negative connotations that some people have with this document. If you cannot agree with this document because it is related to the climate crisis, you should at least be able to agree that this could benefit society in a larger way.

The Green New Deal sounded very appealing with proposed concepts such as, "to secure for all people of the United States for generations to come: clean air and water, climate and community resiliency, healthy food, access to nature, and a sustainable environment" and other goals that will benefit our nation, as well was the entire world. I believe that The Green New Deal is the first legislative step towards a brighter future. As it mentions, it would finally put into official writing that anthropogenic climate change is occurring at a rate detrimental to our environment, and we would exact steps and devote government time and energy to combating this trend. It does sound like the Green New Deal truly is a deal, or a compromise between activists and deniers. Well, not really, but the diction used avoids "trigger words" that would immediately turn a climate denying citizen against the deal. However, this isn't to say that the Green New Deal is without flaws. It must tread the line between being effective, but also able to get passed through the legislative branch, and accepted by American society. This puts the Deal in an awkward place due to being able to do two essentially mutually impossible goals. Unfortunately, while America might be finally on the verge of turning over a new leaf, more must be done by the US to aid countries that will be affected by our previous actions. The US now owes a huge amount to these countries unable to fend for themselves.

I agree that the greatest importance of the Green New Deal is that it is a first step. It encompasses large issues and shoots for ambitious goals but we have to acknowledge the extent of the climate crisis before we can start to resolve it. It is a tough spot to be in politically if you trust the urgency of the climate crisis but also have to be aware of not being alarmist or pushing deniers farther from accepting the issue. I found the deal to be very accessible in language and structure. The support of each part by data also boosts its readability as one can trust in one point before moving onto the next and the ambitious goals turn out to seem appropriate since the issue is presented so well. I agree that we owe a lot to the rest of the world and the U.S. needs to recognize the role we've played in causing the climate crisis and then we need to take responsibility for that by stepping up, changing our actions, and helping less equipped parts of the world to grow as we have, but sustainably.

When I saw people in Bangladesh eat less meat than people in the United States, face much more starvation and encounter serious climate disasters in their daily lives, I was astonished. It is obvious that people in Bangladesh suffered much more than people in the United States, although the Americans are the ones that damaged the environment the most. I think it is our responsibility to help those people in Bangladesh who endured great pains due to our behaviors. In general, I agree with the main point stated in the Green New Deal. In my viewpoint, what we really should do is to consider about how to solve the problem we created rather than focusing on who should be blamed for the climate crisis. I believe if we unite together and take actions immediately to make changes, the situation would be better in the future.

Wendy, I agree with you that it should be our responsibility to help the people in Bangladesh. The fact that we are disproportionately emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is more than enough reason to call the government and individuals to help the developing countries who are suffering from our actions. I think Ken does a fantastic job explaining the differences between Environmental, Social, and Climate Justice. I also found Bangladesh as an important example to portray all three types of injustices that are directly caused by our actions and the fact that we are releasing 25% of the world’s greenhouse gases despite being 4% of the world’s population. I also agree with your statement that we should “consider how to solve the problem we created rather than focusing on who should be blamed for the climate crisis.” While the easy answer, and an answer that we do not want to admit, is the fact that we, ourselves, should be blamed for the climate crisis, I think it is all the more important more us to use the resources we have to come up with solutions. 


                           <br><br>


 The Green New Deal outlines a very important fact about the United States and the responsibilities we have to the world. Since we are a leading developed country with way more resources, wealth, and technology, the United States must pave the way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. In addition, the United States has to assist other developing countries in growing sustainably and helping other countries to create their own Green New Deal. In order for the United States to be able to impact others, we must focus on ourselves first. Climate injustice can be seen in Bangladesh, but it is also very prominent in the United States. The Green New Deal points out the immense wealth gap in the United States and how this inequality creates injustice in poor and colored communities. Landfills, fossil fuel industries, and other pollutants are built right next to poor communities because these people lack the power in our capitalist society to fight back against the local government or big corporate companies. We must enact policies to create equality among all people in the United States and eliminate environmental injustice in our own country. 


                           <br><br>


 Finally, I also agree that the statistics and examples Ken provided in this video were eye-opening and shocking. The fact that the U.S consumes so much more food, owns way more cars and flies way more than the average individual in Bangladesh is a terrible statistic. It just shows how climate justice must be achieved and is a problem that must be addressed now. We cannot wait because as Americans are installing better infrastructure and buying “protection” or insurance for their homes, millions of people in Bangladesh are losing their homes from rising sea levels. Who are the main perpetrators of rising sea levels? Us.

I knew that hunger was greatest in developing countries but I did not know that one in ten people across the globe were experiencing daily chronic hunger. Like yourself I am also in shock because the United States in contrast has an obese population of fourty percent. I agree that it is our responsibility as a leading country and as the greatest emitter of CO2 to help underdeveloped countries like Bangladesh to improve their current situation in regards to the effects of climate change. Global climate change is affecting the poor the most as evident with the floods in Bangladesh killing five thousand people and destroying seven billion homes each year. This is a serious climate injustice because the developing countries who emit the least amount of atmospheric CO2 are unable to protect themselves from natural disasters like the wealthy countries that emit the most CO2.
                           <br><br>

The Green New Deal recognizes human activity as the cause for climate change and seeks to help the planet combat the issue. The United States in this new legislature is held accountable for the disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions yet is given the oppportunity to use their high technological capacity to transform and reduce the amount of emissions all around the world. Some of the Green New Deal’s goals are to stop the transfer of jobs and pollution overseas along with ensuring that public lands, waters, and oceans are protected.
<br><hr>

I thoroughly agree with this comment. The US and the rest of the developed world has caused most of the damage to the planet and the fact that these countries will suffer because of what we did is horrible and we should help them out. But, I honestly believe that before we start helping others out, we should fix the problems that are causing these devastating effects. We need to elect people that will help to fix the planet, and pass laws such as suggested in the Green New Deal that will result in actual change. If we just start helping out other countries that are in need when they need it, nothing really will be resolved because these events will just keep occurring until actual change happens. It’s like if a balloon had a whole in it and every time we just put tape over the whole, but later on a new whole would appear so we just kept putting tape on the balloon and didn’t realize the balloon should just be replaced instead of us trying to fix a broken balloon. At this point, the whole balloon or environmental policies need to be updated so that problems won’t always keep occurring. This may seem unjust, and it really is so maybe we should help out while we fix ourselves, but the top priority has to be fixing what's broken because if not it will continue to hurt the countries that are being hurt. Now I don’t feel as if we have a right to interfere with other countries' governments and such, but if we could influence Bangladesh and other countries to adopt strong environmental policies that would be very beneficial. I also believe that we should help to invest in these other countries since they need to begin to develop and they need to do that without using non-renewable resources. Anyways, what the US did is not just and should have never happened, but the US does need to fix itself, and should probably help to fix the rest of the world as well since it was a large contributor to the problems that will occur in these places.

I agree with you Wendy. I do think that it is the job of developed countries to help countries in poverty like Bangladesh. After reading about the Green New Deal, introduced by democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward J Marley, I felt a little more reassured that there are politicians who are seeking to make a change in the way greenhouse gas emissions are being so freely used. I found it very interesting that in underdeveloped countries, the goal is to use more energy that is renewable and sustainable. This makes sense because the people living in countries like this lack clean water, safe housing, and food to eat.
                           <br><br>

The statistics used in Ken's video really exemplify the severity of the situation. The amount of meat eaten in the US compared to the people in Bangladesh is a staggering number. This is remarkable to learn about after hearing how the meat industry is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. The statistic that 44 million people in Bangladesh are starving is also frightening. This is made even worse when considering that about 1/2-1/3 of all food is completely wasted. I really hope that the Green New Deal will be able to effectively provide people with higher paying jobs, clean air, clean water, healthy food, and other basic human rights. Ultimately, I hope that the world can get to net-zero emissions by the year 2050.

When I think about or meet people who are extremely patriotic about this country, I wonder if they understand the true damage this country does to, not only it’s own citizens who are low-income, minorities, etc. but those who are underprivileged in other countries such as Bangladesh. I believe it is okay for anyone to love their country, but it is crucial that those same people are pushing toward equity inside and outside of America. However, I personally don’t see that often being the case (do I have to mention our current president and that people ACTUALLY voted for him?). America is a country that likes to brag about it’s money yet fails to provide basic needs for many citizens. On top of this, we are abusing developing countries for their products just as we do with fast fashion. Perhaps what’s most disturbing is that we have the power to create change. Our GOVERNMENT has the power to create change, but that’s not happening because America is selfish and corrupt. 

                           <br><br>

With the climate crisis being as serious as it is, it’s surprising to me that a country as boastful as America wouldn’t take the initiative to lead us and other countries in the right direction by implementing efficient solutions. The Green New Deal is something I believe we truly need. Not only is it acknowledging our climate problem, but it’s looking at ways to improve the life of underprivileged groups in America as a whole.

I liked how the Green New Deal resolution encouraged a nation-wide mobilization, similar to that of the 20th century New Deal, to address and mitigate the climate crisis. I think that sort of view on this environmental transformation we must make as a country is the best and most effective way to go about it. Like the resolution said, as the United States, we should strive to be a leader in the world, as we always have been, and we should approach the issue of climate change with the same outlook we did in the past when mobilizing for confronting other pressing global issues, like World War II. I also think it was important how the resolution went into the issue of injustice in regards to climate change. As Ken mentioned, developed countries like our own have contributed far more to climate change than poorer, developing countries - and yet we will not have to suffer as bad of consequences, because we have more resources. However, while I did find the overall message and direction of the resolution to be positive and effective, it did seem to be a little bit vague, and it also talked about many other issues that don’t seem directly related to the issue at hand - such as the mention of federal government guaranteed jobs and housing. In all, while I think the resolution could use some refining, I think it was a bold step in the right direction to get the people of our country and the government to recognize the problem of climate change, and take action to mitigate it.

I, too, think that the Green New Deal is rather vague and convoluted with other aspects within the American government and society. For example, "to create millions of good, high-wage jobs in the United States" to me seems unrelated in regards of addressing the climate crisis and in general seems very naive. Of course, it's good to strive for such positive societal goals, but at this point in time, I see promises like these as overly optimistic lip service and simply distractions to get more support from the general public. I believe in the climate crisis and think everyone should be aware and take action, however, I think the Green New Deal promises too much and is overall too confident in what can be achieved. Although it's fine to aim high, I think the people who proposed this resolution should have explained the plan as it as instead of sugar coating it.

It’s a strange thing to balance. The U.S. released a disproportionate amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Now, most of us (yikes!) know what we’ve done, and want to prevent the emissions of greenhouse gases from increasing any further. The best way to do this is to prevent developing countries from turning to burning fossil fuels for energy. So should the U.S. be responsible for making sure developing countries have laws disallowing burning fossil fuels? I mean, who are we to talk? Why should anyone listen to us?
                            <br><br>
Of course developing countries shouldn’t burn fossil fuels. It would steeply increase the amount of greenhouse gas emissions to a level that once established would be extremely difficult to come back from. But the U.S. made the mistake, learned about the mistake, and STILL hasn’t fixed it. We are in absolutely no position to tell anyone what to do. So much for being the leaders of the free world. In terms of climate change prevention, we have been the primary example of what not to do.
                           <br><br>
 In the meantime, the U.S. must take responsibility for aiding countries that experience the damages of climate change. We were the ones who caused it. It’s the least we can do.

I wish I could say I’m surprised about all of this but at this point it would be redundant. I don’t think much of anything is going to be done to help countries such as Bangladesh. Let alone our government thinking about anyone but themselves. In the green new deal, we see that while the house was trying to cut back on greenhouse emissions domestically as well as create jobs and regulate infrastructure, they neglected to mention any aid they would be providing countries who are being affected by climate change the most. The reason it wasn’t mentioned is because they don’t intend to help clean up the mess that they caused. We in the U.S. account for a disproportionate amount of carbon and methane gases being released into the atmosphere. A great point that needs to be brought up more often is that in these countries where people don’t have food, that don’t have jobs, or maybe even water, there will be no way for them to adjust to the effects of climate change. Whereas in America, we can adjust to these changes rapidly, if the country comes together for a unanimous, bipartisan issue such as global warming. Until these developing countries have formed an industrious economy build off of the continual purchases of seemingly infinite products, they shouldn’t have to pay for our misdeeds.

I agree that the United States is most likely not going to do anything for Bangladesh or anyone else. Politicians mainly care about themselves, and so do many other people in the United States. We know that when it comes to climate change, not many people care, we saw that in the polls. Eventually, it might be possible to change the Earth’s outcome, but I think with the way things are going it’s very unlikely that this will happen. The only thing United States citizens care about is what’s best for them. Sadly, this means Bangladesh and other countries suffering because of the United States might never be helped. I hope I’m wrong and that we can get our act together to help people from other countries. We need a Green New Deal that is selfless and helps others. It’s unbelievable to me that we continue to think only about ourselves and not the people we impact as well.


<br><hr>
You made a good point. The issue of developing countries facing the consequences of America’s excessive carbon emissions needs to be addressed. It’s a sad reality that we live in, where our country most likely will do little to nothing in order to help countries like Bangladesh cope with the effects of climate change. In this video, Ken pointed out that wealthier countries are better equipped to handle environmental disasters, such as fires and flooding, than poor countries. It’s so frustrating that the leaders of the U.S. government, like Trump, are so ignorant to the extent of our accountability and underestimate our duty to send aid to poorer countries. Climate injustice needs to stop.

Before this class I have heard of Bernie Sander and other democratic politicians mention the Green New Deal, but had no clue what it was or its importance. I think that it should be passed immediately and maybe if we get Sanders into office our world will not be doomed by 2050. I believe that with all the damage we have caused to this planet we should be the first ones to take a big step in finding a solution. The poor countries really have no control over what they can do considering he little Green House Gas emissions they let out. Coming from the younger generation I believe that we are the ones to make this change. It is upsetting to see how detrimental our actions are, but knowing that the Green New Deal is a solution to this gives me some hope that we can recover. Hopefully other countries can look at the United States and learn a lesson on how a country should and should not be run.

After hearing Ken’s comparison of the United States and Bangladesh, I can’t help but feel guilty for what Americans are doing to a third-world country like Bangladesh and wonder how many other countries are majorly affected by the greedy actions of Americans. I personally think that since America was one of the major countries with high carbon emissions percentage, we should help out Bangladesh. For example, when Ken spoke about the fire that occurred in 2018 and how many resources Americans have because we are considered a first world country and countries like Bangladesh have no other resources so whenever there is a natural disaster, they couldn’t really do anything. As a major contributor to natural disasters that have been occurring more frequently throughout the globe, America should help out third world countries with the resources we have that could be saving people’s lives instead of just watching.

                           <br><br>

I know people are going to be angry that their tax money will be used to help other people in different countries but they have to understand that their actions of unlimited spending and carbon emission do come with a price and their actions are actually killing people in other countries because they simply do not have the resources we currently have. I think this is really sad because most Americans are not thinking about how their actions are the reason why people in third world countries are suffering. I do admit that before this class, I rarely think about how my actions will affect people who live thousands of miles away from me. I live so far from them so why does it matter what I do? Through this class, I was able to understand no matter what I do, it affects every living thing on this planet and before I do anything, I should think about the consequences that come with it.

I too agree that people would be upset if their tax dollars were going to aid people not even in their own country, but like you, I think that something needs to be done to assist these third world countries who do nothing but live their lives and facilitate the American culture. I believe though that the majority of the aid should come from those who have an unnecessary amount of wealth as the gap between the top 1% and the poorest in the world is absolutely ridiculous. The world is run by very few people who have accumulated all of the wealth and instead of aiding countries who benefit their economy and drive their net worth up, they would rather keep their money and constantly desire more never happy with what they have. There is no reason that some people around the world should be starving to death and suffering from dehydration because they lack a clean water source while other travel on private jets to exotic locations at the snap of a finger because they craved a cuisine from another country. It makes me sick thinking of drastic this gap is and how millions of people suffer every day while some people are swimming in money and other people suffer from obesity. Like Ken mentioned, we have an obesity problem in this country while there are children who lack food so bad that their stomach begins to bloat out and their skin touches bone and not muscle. We need to find a solution to this and not only fix the problems of homelessness, starvation, and lack of clean water within the US but within those third world countries who have aided us in numerous ways. 
                           <br><br>

I was disgusted after I watched the documentary showing the factory workers in Bangladesh in horrible conditions and constantly in danger of death and after listening to Ken in this video I was even more disgusted. Not only do Americans cause a vast amount of emissions, consume the most meat world wide, and per capita have 14,000% more vehicles than Bangladesh, but the majority of Americans do not think that the way they are living is wrong in any way. We saw dairy farmers explain how they did not believe their cows were negatively affecting the environment and we hear about the obesity problem but there are no solutions to curve that but even then, most Americans do not think that the climate crisis is an imminent danger but it is. As a leading nation we need to better ourselves and create a better world as an example for countries worldwide in an effort to save the world, but until Americans take a part in the effort than most change will not occur. I too Betty did not think about how my actions affected people on the other side of the globe, and if I did I did not think they affected them in a negative manner. After taking this class I have become more educated on the climate crisis and more aware of how my actions affect those around me making me more conscious of my decisions. I think the Us as a nation needs to get off the high horse of bigger is better, the consumer culture that we have must go, people must become more aware of their consumption and the wealth needs to be redistributed to those who are actually in need and are at risk of dying rather than the support the luxurious lifestyles of the wealthiest of consumers.

<br><hr>
I agree with the points that you made throughout your comment and found them quite interesting. While I knew that America contributed a large amount to the overall carbon emissions, it wasn't until Ken compared our emissions to Bangladesh's that I completely understood what a great deal of carbon emissions we release as a country. I learned that the citizens of Bangladesh are bearing the consequences, however they are not receiving any of the comforts that we have. For instance, while in America most families have more than one car, in smaller third world countries, most families don't have the luxury of having even one car at their disposal. These third world countries are facing natural disasters similar and far worse than the ones that have taken place in the States, but they  lack the resources that we have here, so these natural disasters are far worse for them and can dictate their entire life.
                           <br><br>
We can't expect others to pay for what we have done, simply because of the fact that they are not strong enough to fight back. I also believe that we should aid these other countries with the disasters they face as a consequence of the problem that we largely contributed to. These countries lack the resources to help their citizens, and as a country with those resources  and power we owe it to them to aid them through. 
                           <br><br>
 I agree with your point that most don’t see this as a problem because they visually can't see the problem. Just because it is out of their sight does not mean that these events are not taking place. We need to take some sort of action to help these countries, because they do not have the means to do it on their own.

The Green New Deal has been mentioned several times in class, but I didn’t know much about it. I knew a young, female, Puerto Rican congresswoman proposed it – which in itself is a huge step forward in our society – and now I know it was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I knew it addressed climate change. I knew it was extremely controversial in terms of partisanship. It wasn’t until actually reading through the relatively short document that I understood that the Green New Deal is so much more than what I had previously thought it was. The Green New Deal first and foremost deals with the changing climate and its imminent impacts on our world and daily lives. Yet it took a turn I wasn’t expecting. It lists certain issues that didn’t seem like they had anything to do with climate change: declining life expectancy, the race and gender income inequalities, wage stagnation. These issues, according to the Green New Deal, are related to climate change because climate change disproportionately affects more vulnerable communities and those who historically have had less power. 

                           <br><br>

To my surprise, the Green New Deal is very optimistic in its scope. While it seems like all of the change that is required to save our planet is too much to accomplish, Ocasio-Cortez lays it out simply and methodically. Is it simplifying the difficulty of the issue too much or making it easier to comprehend? I want to believe that she writes this way to put into perspective that, if we really do care about the environment and work to mitigate the climate crisis to the best of our abilities, these actions are feasible. 

                           <br><br>

I think the most enticing part about the Green New Deal for the American public is that it will theoretically create more jobs even though jobs will be lost in the process of weaning off of fossil fuel use. The job market will be full of positions to build new high-speed rails, create zero-emissions infrastructure, and upgrade to energy-efficient power grids, to name a few. I have hope that saving the environment and maintaining jobs with livable wages are not mutually exclusive and can be achieved.

I can 100% agree with your first paragraph. I had somewhat heard of these topics but not as much as I know now. These 14 pages explained so much more to me and now I understand why America has to do all these different things for population. Almost everything leads back to climate change. 
                           <br><br>
Ocasio Cortez does highlight our current situation. I can’t decide if our actions are truly enough but I do agree that we should still keep going. I think the second half of The Green New Deal is something to look forward to. I was surprised in hearing that it would guarantee health care and create jobs even though it’d also mean some would be lost. As great as it sounds I know there will be a catch, but at least the topic of climate change is getting some political attention and becoming known by a larger audience.

The policies of the Green New Deal have the chance to make impactful environmental changes, so I hope it eventually gets passed in the future. In AOC’s video, I thought her guidelines were like a no-brainer to many people, but to many other people across the country, it might seem radical. In my opinion, although these guidelines would help our planet’s current state improve, I highly doubt that it will get implemented. I am not a fan of AOC and her politics but I think she is right when it comes to climate change. But then again, she herself is a hypocrite because she constantly uses Uber as a way of transportation and flys across the United States. Like Ken said in his lectures, traveling using a fossil fueled vehicle does a tremedous amount of damge to the planet and we as a society should refrain from traveling this way. Instead of using a car, we should travel using a bike or if the desired destination is located far, travel by train. AOC likes to complain but doesn’t take much action and I believe personal action is the best and matters the most. Protesting and complaining honestly does nothing and instead that energy should be put towards action. I am tired of people talking about change instead of taking the necessary steps in actually making a difference. I myself have already adjusted the way I live so that the planet does not become further damaged. I no longer purchase clothing and other items with a consumerist mindset. When I buy an item, I ponder on how long it will serve me and that dictates whether or not I will actually purchase it. I no longer want to contribute to the consumerist mindset, instead I want to live a minimalist lifestyle. AOC should do what I am doing and actually change her lifestyle with the planet’s health in mind.

In my opinion, the repeated comparison between the U.S. and Bangladesh in this video is very powerful- 1 in 55 people in Bangladesh use travel each year while the average American travels by plane about 2.5 times a year and 4 in 1000 people in Bangladesh own a car while 838 out of 1000 Americans own a car. It really puts everything in perspective when considering America’s contribution to the climate crisis in relation to other countries. As such a strong and wealthy nation, America has the potential to help instigate change towards reducing the harmful effects from climate change. This is definitely a lot of responsibility, but considering how 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions were placed by America, I think we owe it to the rest of the world. It would be great if America and other developed countries could help the poorer nations establish renewable energy sources and other ways to be environmentally friendly. However, there are so many other global issues that already exist that I think it will be difficult to prioritize climate change instead. Therefore, it’s important to recognize the indirect positive results that can occur if we take steps to mitigate climate change- stopping companies from manufacturing clothing in horrible sweatshops is just one example.

In the Green New Deal, the role of the US on climate crisis is mentioned. The contrast of the amount of green house gas emission between the US and Bangladesh is shockingly huge. Hearing about the conditions of workers in Bangladesh have to work in and how they have to accept any development they can get to in order to have money to survive even though they know they are sacrificing their natural resource breaks my heart. I hope when they say that there is going to be net-zero global emission in 2050, they are going to fulfill it.

I had heard a lot about the Green New Deal, but I had never read it. I’m a big fan of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the change she’s been enacting in Congress. I didn’t know how much of the Green New Deal I would fundamentally agree with. It begins with climate solutions that will help with emissions, but continues to name ways to increase the value of labor and limit large companies. Large companies feed each others’ competition so fiercely that the 1% will do whatever they can to get the upper hand. So much pollution could be limited with the development of fundamental human rights as a necessity. Workers notice things within their environment, and are more likely to understand environmental and social risks associated with their work.

My whole life, I’ve been terrified of not only the state of the planet I’m being left with, but also the economy. Working class people are so disenfranchised that I’m scared to go into the working world. The average American has so much less buying power than they had in the past - and we’re using it for the worst, cheapest crap. I want to have a strong economy, with businesses I can trust and rely on. I want to live in a world where I could open my own business if I wanted and not be shut down or bought out by a huge conglomerate. This Green New Deal gave me so much hope. It’s so necessary for the economic wellbeing of America.

While I agree that the Green New Deal is absolutely necessary in taking the first step towards a healthier planet, there is one specific line that stood out to me:
                           <br><br>
“Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes that a new national, social, industrial, and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal era is a historic opportunity” This enormous cultural change will not be easy to convince those so heavily rooted in the industries that contribute the most to climate change. Then again, it has been done before with World War II. At this point in time, every person is facing the same thing to varying degrees, and that is the war of climate change. 

                           <br><br>

I strongly believe that the U.S. needs to take the lead and responsibility for what we have done. Besides, I really don’t understand how people wouldn’t want to live meaningful and simple lives. And it is especially quite unsettling to hear the comparisons between Bangladesh and the U.S. and their consumptions of meat, and use of flying and driving. 6,600% more meat consumption, 14,000% greater per capita with flying, 21,000% greater with driving. These are startling numbers and we need to reign them down.

                           <br><br>



First, the U.S. should practice degrowth and completely change its economic and social infrastructures. Then, since we have caused most of the environmental damage in third world countries, we have the responsibility of helping while also being cautious of the white savior complex. While I don’t think we should impose laws on other countries, I think we could encourage officials to consider (Not sure how that would work).

One of the most important aspects of the Green New Deal as outlined in this archive is that one of the main goals of this plan is to not only make the United States the international leader on climate action but to then use our resources, knowledge, and technology to aid other countries in accomplishing the same feat. I think it is very important to recognize that the United States cannot expect other countries such as China and India to create systemic change regarding their carbon emissions and footprints without us doing it first as we have the resources and the technology to not only accomplish these changes, but to help them as well. Another aspect of the Green New Deal which I felt was particularly important was the goal to secure clean water and air, healthy food, and access to nature and a sustainable environment. The fact that these should all just be considered basic human rights, but are not and have to be argued for is pretty disappointing, and so I commend the Green New Deal for focusing on human rights rather than just a way to reduce emissions. Overall, I feel that The Green New Deal is a very detailed and effective plan, and could play a monumental role in significantly reducing the United States' and potentially, the rest of the world's emissions. While the archive states that the goals of the Green New Deal can be accomplished by a 10 year national mobilization, as this has yet to commence, the question remains as to whether the Green New Deal will become a reality soon enough to save our planet.

I agree that it is imperative that we be the example through the Green New Deal. Like you said, we are leaders and the rest of the world is looking to see how we will fair by going through with this deal. It will be interesting considering how this deal is heavily focused on us in the US reshaping our economy with government support. We have talked plenty about how government officials are corrupt and in the pockets of many, so I think it will be interesting to see what happens. Getting a unified effort from both our government and people in the US is the only thing I am skeptical about because our emissions have been ruining the landscape and lives of many from other countries before, yet we did not change anything significant. Hopefully the reality of our world will settle with many in our country. The fact we are going to lose 99% of our coral reefs in the near future and that 30 million in Bangladesh will be affected by sea level rise should be enough to scare people to change their ways. From policy, diet, and transport, none of it is worth destroying our planet.

In the video Ken compares the United States and Bangladesh, he mentions meat consumption, the use of air travel, and car ownership. The statistics that Ken givens in this video are very eye opening and seem surreal. Eating green is a way that we can all reduce our meat consumption however in places like Bangladesh it would not be so difficult since the per capita consumption is 4 pounds per year. On the contrary where the United States consumes 265 pounds per year, it is not difficult to stop eating meat or simply reduce its simply that Americans are just too “lazy”. Of course we want everyone to do something about climate change except us, the United States, the country that puts a significant amount of green house gases into the atmosphere. In Bangladesh only 4 people in a thousand own a car whereas in the united states 838 people own a car which is more than 50% percent. I feel that this number will only continue to increase as the population of the US increases. Ken also mentions the Rana Plaza incident, unfortunately that is not the only country that social injustices are occurring. El Salvador, China, Africa and the list of countries continues, all countries have been affected by social injustice what we are doing is immoral. People should not be put in dangerous conditions or work at very low paying wages to the point where it is basically slave labor. I believe that we should help out countries like Bangladesh after all we have the highest green house emissions, developing/third world countries are suffering because of our desires in stuff.

In the video, Ken talked about injustices in our world, especially three types: social, environmental, and climate. From the example of Bangladesh, I learn that these three injustices are closely connected to each other. Because of the social injustice, developed country builds factories in developing countries. In this way, factories produce lots of pollution and destroy the local environment. As a result, this leads to climate changes, which further cause natural disasters. Many developing countries are poor, so they have no other choice besides accepting factories in order to develop economics. In addition, I was surprised by the topic of ambulance equipment mentioned by Ken. To be honest, I never thought about this before. When facing disasters, developed countries are able to save their citizens by ambulance equipment. However, for developing countries, people suffer more because they do not have these valuable equipment. This fact makes really sad. We not only need more deals like The Green New Deal but also implementation of them.

Yes, I agree with you. It is a constant cycle that less privileged people have to deal with. The rich help cause the damage but it is the poor who suffer from it. It is really unfortunate how these injustices occur. Hopefully a New Green Deal does take place and the US along with the world’s leading countries can make steps to amend this situation.

Without a doubt I believe it should be a top priority for the US to ensure that places like Bangladesh have proper labor and environmental regulations. I'm not sure how the U.S would enforce this but maybe as a country we could put forth a policy that ensures that all imported goods that are bound to be sold in U.S markets were manufactured humanely and sustainably.  In order to help Bangladesh, companies that have outsourced labor to these countries should be held financially responsible for building infrastructure for the economy of places like Bangladesh to build upon. Moreover, these companies should pay for remediation of places in bangladesh that have been destroyed by fast fashion factories. It is clear to me that since the U.S should spearhead efforts to improve environmental and labor regulations in third world countries that we trade with. Unfortunately, I don't think it will be easy convincing a large portion of americans to do this.

Growing up, my mother would always recite a Ukrainian saying that translates to "all doings have consequences". In the context of greenhouse gas emissions in America, this saying rings true. The one thing that many people fail to consider in their day to day decisions is the fact that the consequences of our actions may not result in direct consequences to ourselves, but rather that our consequences affect people thousands of miles away from us. When analyzing the Green New Deal, one thing I appreciated was the fact that it acknowledges the heavier impact of climate change on "frontline and vulnerable communities" such as indigenous people. The inclusion and emphasizing of taking action to mitigate the consequences of climate change within this group nods to the awareness that the authors had about the consequences of climate change. 
                           <br><br>
In the same sense, Ken points out the impact of U.S. emissions on the lives of people in Bangladesh, where harsh working environments as a result of fast fashion and high emissions leads to a lower quality of life. Foreign aid paying for the consequences of U.S. emissions is like paying a carbon tax. The externalities produced as a result of U.S. emission in Bangladesh can be compensated through foreign aid. The sad part of this is the fact that those externalities are produced in the first place. While the Green New Deal emphasizes the "frontline and vulnerable communities" in the U.S., it does not talk at all about the ailing countries who also suffer from climate change. I hate to admit it, but it seems a bit ethnocentric to only talk about America's goals and our own development without including a goal for foreign aid to other countries. It's important to consider all of the consequences that the U.S. has with its emissions and especially with the impact of American factories on emissions numbers in other countries.

My thoughts were quite similar to yours in regards to Bangladesh. The comparison between the United States and Bangladesh is insane. I know how awful the United States is, and the fact that Third World countries are going to be detrimentally affected largely because the United States is just sad. And on top of that, the Trump administration is slashing foreign aid, Honestly, I am at a lost for words. America is just disgusting. Then reading that this Green New Deal is just so ethnocentric not talking about foreign aid or other countries. It is frustrating seeing this happen. While these are necessary and important, the United States needs to take responsibility for their actions and work on the impact of other third world countries.
<br><hr>
I love your saying “all doings have consequences” because a lot of the time, people in our generation have a hard time acknowledging that and understanding that what we are doing to our planet currently have horrible effects on human beings living in developing countries and will soon have extremely harmful effects to everyone, no matter where you live or how much money and privilege you have. I agree that it is really important that the Green New  Deal included acknowledgement of the vulnerable communities who are suffering from an  unequal distribution of climate change effects because those communities are the ones who need these policies and legislation the most.  
                            <br><br>
It was interesting to me to read about the consequences that our country will face due to the planet warming by 2 degrees Celsius. The fact that more than $500 billion will be last in annual economic output and that $1 trillion of public infrastructure and coastal real estate in the US could be damaged is hard to even imagine. The amount of money this crisis will cost us is incomprehensible and much more than it would be to start implementing plans that will keep this disaster from getting to a point of no return. 
                           <br><br>
 I  appreciated how this document addresses a variety of different topics and areas that are all related and affected by climate change and proposes solutions and ideas to these issues. The climate crisis is an issue that involves so many different things that must all be addressed in order to mitigate it. Getting this Green New Deal going and active will change so much about the way we live our day to day lives and how we all view the climate crisis. However, in order for this to happen, we must elect officials into government who have the climate crisis as a top priority and are actually going to take action on it, which is something we unfortunately currently lack.

The Green New Deal seems to be intimidating to many people within our country and the globe. Like Ken said it is a global problem but everywhere has a different role and different challenges they need to face in order to stop this problem. Ken goes into the comparison between America and Bangladesh. The statistics he pulled out were crazy in my eyes, in the United States we eat 6,600% more meat than one in Bangladesh, we fly 14,000% more than one in Bangladesh, and automobile ownership in the United States 21,000% greater than in Bangladesh. These numbers are mind boggling, and really put into perspective how the United States is most definitely exceeding the need for things, like air travel, and meat consumption. A big chunk of this climate crisis could be dropped if a large enough group of Americans decided to quit eating meat, quit flying, and take public transportation, or just even reduce these things in their life. The climate crisis is a big problem our world is facing today, and it is going to affect everyone regardless of income, location, social status, nationality, etc. and as humans of this planet we need to put a stop to it.

I agree that the US should play a larger role in fighting climate change because the US has played such a large role in climate change.  It was such a shock to learn that one country has contributed 25% of the greenhouses in the atmosphere.  It is extremely unfair that developing countries have done nearly nothing to contribute to climate change yet those countries are the ones that will suffer most from the effects of climate change.  It is very concerning how little I am aware of the effects of climate change on other people.  Sadly, the fact that the US is so destructive is not common knowledge.  Not very many people know of how climate change is affecting other countries because the US is also affected by it (though the effects on the US are not as devastating as the effects on other countries).
                           <br><br>
The Green New Deal makes a strong argument as to why the US needs to make changes that will combat climate change.  It clearly states how close we are to losing a lot of lives and money due to neglect of how US practices (like eating way too much meat and consumerism) are affecting the environment.  It is important that the document explains how making these changes will not just help the environment, but will also help the US save money.  Many people believe that making changes in order to reduce the US’s carbon footprint will be expensive, so seeing that these changes will save money in the long run helps to weaken that argument.

It is very disappointing to realize and understand that this is only the first time that the United States politicians are even acknowledging the climate crisis. The Green New Deal is an extremely important first step in addressing the climate crisis. However, the issue is that it is not a law but it is only a proposal for the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal and recognize their duties. As far as social and environmental justice issues concern, the green new deal addresses protecting Americans from possible jobs lost and impacts of the people. It also acknowledges the fact the United States is responsible for the most emission of greenhouse gases. As Americans, it is our duty to help the countries who are being the most affected by our actions. It astonished me that We eat 6600 percent more than people in Bangladesh and Air travel in the US is 14,000 percent more than people in Bangladesh. The fact that there is no action in one of the most powerful leading nations in the world is very disappointing. We cannot continue indirectly harming thousands by our actions and not at least have the decency to provide assistance in these times of crisis. It does recognize this in the article that “climate change, pollution, and environmental destruction have exacerbated systemic racial, regional, social, environmental, and economic injustices (referred to in this preamble as “systemic injustices”) by disproportionately affecting indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth (referred to in this preamble as “frontline and vulnerable communities”). The issue is that no Americans are educated or concerned enough about the issue.

I wanted to comment on the Concepts of "Degrowth" and "Responsible growth." As mentioned, the undeveloped countries have to do the responsible growing and the countries like the US have to do the "Degrowth." It's unusual to think of something "Degrowing", especially thinking of a country doing it like the US. I don't mean to be pessimistic, but I highly doubt that we will do any degrowing here in the  U.S. In fact, we are trying to grow more and more. This country tries to find new ways of technology everyday, we try to make our lives easier by inventing things that cause damage to our earth. We love to use things/eat things and never think about the consequences. I think that we also have this idea as Americans that we can do whatever we want. We never think about the damage our actions cause and I don't blame the citizens but rather the corrupt industries. For the undeveloped worlds, I think it will be much easier for them to grow responsibly and I think that a lot of attention needs to be given to these countries. It sucks knowing that these countries will be doing much better than the developed countries and still, this effort will not make much of a difference to the environment. I think the more important thing here is for the developed countries to do some "degrowing," but I have no idea how we will convince our leaders to go "backwards" and not "forward."

Hello, I completely understand where you're coming from! The concept of the United States having to experience "degrowth" for the betterment of the environment is a bit odd, considering how our nation has the reputation for being a place of immense industrial and infrastructural growth. Additionally, Americans love to live large! Living in excess is synonymous with being American. Unfortunately, this deeply-rooted ideology within our society simply isn't sustainable. Perhaps if we educate our country about the hazards of our overabundant lifestyles, people would be more willing to switch their way of life, which would help with the "degrowth" of the United States. However, I fear that by the time we convince Americans to live more sensible lives, it'll be too late.

It's hard to put in perspective the disparity between our so-called per capita contribution compared to our effective per capita contribution. It's hard to see the consequences of the shirt on our back or the car that is just sitting in the driveway. Despite this, Ken shed some light on this, enlightening me to the imbalance in our contributions compared to those from poorer countries. This video brought a little sense of guilt. I have all of these things around me that either I paid for or my family did, yet it's a family in another country who is paying the true price. They a bearing the tribulations of my prosperity and I didn't even realize until now. It's disheartening but I can't really take back what I already have, it's already been made and it's already caused harm. However, Ken mentions in this video and throughout the class that we can contribute to change through political action. The Green New Deal seems to be a step in the right direction but it seemed a little broad in scope so it was hard for me to see what was actually being proposed be done. Hearing about the burden Bangladesh was heartbreaking. They have 40 million people starving and yet we are still taking advantage of them. At what point does the mindset of some people switch from America first to people first.

I really resonate with one of the first points you made about how it is difficult to see the consequences of the products we own or the actions we take. For example, when most people (including myself) go out to shop to buy new clothes, grocery products, or other items, the number one priority on the mind is to buy a product to fulfill some self-centered need or desire. While this is definitely a valid way of thinking, this need/desire sometimes masks the actual consequence of the product. It is very difficult to visualize or think about how the product was made, where it was made, who was involved in its creation, and the impact it has on the environment when purchasing a product when you are so focused on fulfilling this self need. This (very first-world esque) mindset is definitely something that needs to change if people in countries like the USA want to make a real impact in helping the environment. At some point, first-world people need to realize the disparity between the lifestyles that we live as compared to people around the, such as the ones in Bangladesh. While we worry about how it is difficult to cut our meat consumption, people in countries like Bangladesh are suffering from starvation as you mentioned

While the climate crisis is a worldwide issue, it doesn’t always effect the entire world all at once. The first places to see pollution and disruption of land and resources are the poorest ones, like tainted water in Flint and storms powerful enough to debilitate an entire country like Puerto Rico. What’s even more upsetting is that people in poorer communities not only do little to add to emissions, but more importantly can do little in terms of resources and funding to simply rebuild, much less combat the entire issue itself. 
                           <br><br>

It’s the richest that need to take action and use their funds and connections to advocate for change. Whether it’s direct donations, encouraging people to vote, or educating the public on ways to help at home. Many in the US have somehow been conditioned to think that the average citizen is the answer to the billion dollar climate disaster that big oil industries and other corps have caused. I believe that everyone should take action, big or small, but we have to make sure that those with the biggest influence and ability are doing their part to ensure the safety of all living things.

The Green New Deal does a great job at exposing the inevitable tragedies if action is not taken. They not only talk about the environmental effects, but social, economic, and cultural effects as well. Also, I liked how they not only laid out the effects, but explained what effects are already hitting. This could help politicians finally come to grips with reality and stop arguing that this amount of CO2 is good for the earth. They also made this plan appear credible by referencing the New Deal which came out during World War II. With major success in revamping the middle class and improving the lives of so many, the Green New Deal has the potential to do the same thing. Like the New Deal, the Green New Deal aims to provide new, high-wage jobs. By revamping our energy sources there will be many new jobs created and available for people. With new infrastructure we can encourage Americans to live a more sustainable lifestyle. All of these steps are highlighted in the Green New Deal. My favorite part of this resolution is the inclusion of indigenous peoples. They do not just focus on revamping American and making the average, middle class American better off, but repairing and preventing future hardship on "frontline and vulnerable communities. These people who struggle the most but the effects of climate change should be our main focus. We must improve their quality of life because right now it is unacceptable. When Ken said that 40 million people in Bangladesh are starving, 40% of the world is in hunger, starvation, and chronic hunger, 10,000 sq miles or 18% is flooded, 5,000 people killed, 7 million homes destroyed every year, and 30,000 people were left homeless after the last flood. These statistics shocked me, I knew the effects were grave and disastrous, but this high of magnitude is heartbreaking. Imagining this many people homeless wondering where their next meal will come from, while we as Americans worry about having the next best iPhone. The inequality is growing and is disheartening to say the least. After hearing about Bangladesh I feel so guilty complaining about my first world problems.

I agree with everything you have said Lauren. The Green New Deal did a great job in acknowledging climate change and its impacts. I was impressed when I read one of the opening lines stating that “human activity is the dominant cause of climate change.” The Green New Deal went on to cover the physical impacts on the environment, as well as, the economic and social tolls. It’s nice to see that some politicians are taking action to push change and legislation on climate change. Seeming as the Green New Deal isn’t a bill or resolution, this is just a small first step to making big change. This  deal promises to bring jobs to the many who will lose their jobs when the fossil fuel industry is diminished. I found it important and interesting that the Green New Deal addressed the injustices that could come from leaning away from the fossil fuel industry. The deal promotes justice and equality, saying it will bring education and opportunities to all. Ken’s video for the reading was quite hard to hear. I often take for granted all the luxuries that come with living in a developed country. Because of the United States power, we as citizens are often protected from injustices. However, countries like Bangladesh don’t have all the rights and luxuries the United States has. It’s sad to think that those citizens have to take unsafe and unsecure jobs just to live. We live in a country of gluttony and yet billions of people all over the world are starving. It’s not that we don’t have enough food, it’s that we don’t allocate the food equally. It’s hard to put all the responsibility on the United States to take care of the rest of the world. I do think the US should take responsibility for its actions but I think diminishing social injustices is a global issue that all countries need to address.

The Green New Deal is a very ambitious vision for the United States. Its guidelines may seem like a no-brainer to many people currently enrolled in this class, but to many other people across the country, it might seem radical. I feel that we are transitioning from a huge focus on the individual to legislation. Like the New Deal, which the Green New Deal was named after, this piece of legislation aims to set out guidelines for the United States to become carbon-neutral by the mid-century. What is also interesting is that in the bill there was mention of more than just the climate crisis. It also factors economic inequality and systemic racism into account. Like Ken described in the video, hints of climate justice can be observed in the Green New Deal. The US is in a unique position to take the lead in tackling the issues related to the climate crisis. It is up to the people to make their voices heard to their congressmen and women to push new laws aiming at fixing these problems.

I agree with your statement that it is up to us to make our voices heard to our congressmen and women to constantly aim for change and push new laws that would ultimately fix or at least help issues our country faces on a daily day to day basis. Your statement about many people having a radical outlook on this Green New Deal is very realistic and honestly heart wrenching. The fact that so many people cannot seem to grasp the concept of our precious earth deteriorating is saddening, overwhelming, and a huge contribution to the continuous damage being done to our earth. I do like how other issues such as inequality and systematic racism, as mentioned, is beginning to be tied to other crucial issues such as the climate crisis. Each of these issues are just as important towards a bright future and change must be fought for.

After reading the "Green New Deal" I believe it provides the public with a clear look on the U.S.'s role in contributing to the climate crisis domestically and internationally and the reform desperately needed in order to prevent any further damage and destruction that will (and has already) happen because of climate change. The Resolution addresses the U.S.'s historical involvement in the climate crisis by emitting "20% of global greenhouse gas emissions through 2014," and because of that, our country must be held accountable and has the responsibility to the rest of the world to put in all its efforts in combatting the climate crisis. The Green New Deal addresses not only the environmental implications that arise with the climate crisis but the social and economic implications as well. Many people don't seem to realize that a lot of the domestic and global issues they face, such as unemployment, health problems, unstable economy, income inequalities, transportation, jobs, and even immigration all have a lot to do with the climate crisis- a problem that Americans ourselves caused. Americans have always seemed to point the finger at other countries and groups for our problems, but the Green New Deal would force Americans to reevaluate their hazardous lifestyles' impact on the planet and the people, animals, and plants living on it. For a country like Bangladesh which had virtually had little to no impact in emitting carbon into the atmosphere, to suffer and continue to suffer from the disastrous environmental effects of climate change, while the U.S. who has contributing majority of the carbon emissions has suffered rather little in scale compared to Bangladesh is troubling. The U.S. since its founding has done nothing but impose itself on the rest of the globe and try to establish itself as a leading global power by exploiting other nations, should have the responsibility of taking a leadership role in ending a problem that it largely started. The Green New Deal shows us of the potential this accountability could have in making America and the globe a better place.

Astonishingly, the three aspects Ken mentioned that we can improve on are the huge main problems we should face right now. Since I’ve read the Green New Deal proposal during high school, I know this can be a serious plan to be supported and carried out by the government. I was shocked by the massive differences that Bangladesh and the United States have in terms of the social, environment, and climate problems. Social injustice forces people to accept and face it just to make their livings; environmental injustice leads to human rights issues in which people do not have the right to change the impacts factories pollution have provided; climate injustice, in fact, increases the gap between rich and poor. The example of Bangladesh shocked me. I have never thought about how the situation in Bangladesh would be so terrible and helpless. I think the United States should utilize the Resolutions and Marshall Plan to provide them more supplies. I am confident and optimistic about the United States using the Green New Deal to change the current situation. I also agree with your statement that the United States should lead the world to end the problem.

It really shocked me when seeing how much American ownership or consumptions are compared to developing countries, Bangladesh alike. The 1600 times percent consumption of meat per capita, more than 10 thousand times or even 20 thousand times ownership of cars and plane taking. It is really hard to imagine that there are actually billions of people who have chronic starving while I take everything in my life as granted. I have grandparents who suffered from lack of supplies back in their 30s and they taught me to cherish every mouth of food I have ever since I can understand language, but I only thought that was something needed to be worried in before instead now. The fact that people in countries emit less CO2 would actually suffered more from the damage of higher temperature as the CO2 in atmosphere rise, they are still worrying about what to eat the next day in their life, while someone on the other side of world made them have to burden such extra life stress like the severe flood or so. This injustice really breaks my heart.

I too was super shocked about the mass difference between US consumption and developing countries. My parents immigrated from a third world country, and they always tell me how good the life I am living now is compared to the ones they had back in their country. They told me of how they had to work really hard to eat everyday, and feed their family. The statistics along with my parent's stories about their childhood made me realize just how sheltered I am to live a luxurious life, previously unaware of the suffering people of developing countries go through in order to go on with their life.

It is kind of incredible that the green new deal did not get more attention. I know that it did get a lot of media attention when it came time for congress to vote on it and I did see a lot of conservatives bashing it, but after reading it I'm surprised people didn't talk about it more. It brings up a lot of revolutionary ideas in order to better our chances against the climate crisis. It seems like everything is pretty achievable too, especially the way that it is presented. It addresses such a wide range of problems with reasonable solutions and evidence to support the solutions. Reading about all the issues that america is facing just shows that we need this or something like it to be passed.

The Green New Deal very much shocked me because I didn't know how progressive it was in the US taking the blame for the emissions of greenhouse gases worldwide. This resolution is very important because it shows that the US is a world leader that can lead the changes necessary to protect our environment from the worst possible scenarios. We have already caused 25% of global emissions as a country and gained so much money because of our greediness so we have the means to fight climate change. Countries like Bangladesh are suffering due to our mistakes and we need to tackle this issue to give the people of Bangladesh the healthy and safe lives they deserve. In the video, Ken mentioned that 4 out of 1000 people in Bangladesh own a car, while in the US 838 out of 1000 people own a car, which means that per capita automobile ownership in the US is 21,000% more than Bangladesh. This statistic truly startled me because as with the other two comparison statistics Ken mentioned, this shows how unfair we are making the world. We are perpetuating climate change but most Americans don't suffer the consequences of it yet. This climate justice issue can only be resolved with a resolution such as the Green New Deal. But, to do this we need to support politicians who see how important it is to take on this resolution and make a change in the world for the better.

                           <br><br>

 Politicians are the real people that can make a powerful change in the world, especially in a powerful and leading country as the one we live in. As we come closer to primaries and even the general election for president, we need to take into account who will do something about climate change and who will brush it aside. We also need to take into account the importance for voting for local political offices because change has to start somewhere. For example, in an earlier video Ken mentioned the importance of reducing parking in Santa Barbara because it makes people feel like they have to drive everywhere when walking, biking, and taking public transportation are all smart and sustainable ways to travel. Although it is amazing that our federal government is beginning to understand the importance of climate justice and climate change, they need to actually take action and for this to happen, we as a nation have to show them how important it is for us (their primary goal as politicians is always to get re-elected so they listen to their constituents).

It’s sad that the US taking the blame for their contribution to emissions is considered progressive, especially because, as you’ve said, politicians, especially those in powerful countries like the US, are the real people that can make powerful changes in the world. So far my biggest takeaway in this class is that the US does more than its share of global emissions, which disproportionately affects poorer countries, yet we have a hard time implementing actual solutions. I never actually read the Green New Deal before, but now, after firsthand seeing the progressive approach AOC takes, I understand why so many people admire her. It’s extremely inspiring how AOC was able to address an issue that so many other older and supposedly more experienced politicians before her failed to do, and because of that, it’s clear why many conservatives consider her a radical in modern America. She addresses many “systemic inequities” related to climate change, such as how the climate crisis unproportionally affects marginalized groups such as people of color, women, the elderly, and indigenous groups- which no other politician in America before her has done.

Hi Lian! I had a very similar response to reading the Green New Deal and watching this week's film introducing it. love that you brought up how progressive the Green New Deal is in blaming the US for GHG emissions worldwide. I agree that this shows the power the US has in the global economy and just how influential our actions are on the countries around us. What resonated with me the most, after watching Ken's video, was how he explained our plan of action, or what he thinks it should be. He said that the developed world needs "de-growth" and the developing world needs "sustainable, responsible growth". In a way, this is the Green New Deal in simple terms. But, it is important to note that both of these resolutions require cultural change.

I was also very shocked when reading the Green New Deal. It made me both very sad and frustrated that our country's mistakes are the reason for another countries suffering. These poor and innocent people who already have much less than we do don't deserve to be put through these things for something that they are not responsible for. When Ken mentioned how sea level rising was killing off 5,000 people living in Bangladesh each year I was completely horrified. How is this something that we do not know about? How are that many people dying EACH YEAR and our country just shakes it off and does not take any sort of responsibility. It is disgusting how ignorant the politicians in this world are. We have the power and money to change these things, yet we choose to turn a blind eye to them because it is more convenient for us.

This is not the first time I heard about the Green New Deal but it is the first time for me to see exactly what was written in this resolution. The documentation first stated that human activities were the main cause of climate change over the past century. (By the way, I was very surprised to see these many politicians agreed with this.) Then it goes into detail and talks about how climate change will affect our living environment and the planet, and why it is urgent for us to act now. Lastly, the statement proposed with “goals and projects” the government of US should do in order to solve the current issues we are facing now and will possibly happen during the future (example would be “repairing and upgrading infrastructures in the US by eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emission as much as technologically feasible.”) One thing I agree the most in the Green New Deal is that it “must be developed through transparent and inclusive consultation, collaboration, and partnership with frontline and vulnerable communities, labor unions, worker cooperatives, civil society groups, academia, and businesses...” Even Though this resolution is written for the government of the United States, I believe when it stated “vulnerable communities”, it is not limited to communities in the US, but also worldwide. 
                           <br><br>
As Ken said in the video, “car ownership in the US is 2100% greater in Bangladesh.” After all, the United States itself contributed to 20% of the worldwide carbon emission. It is reasonable for me to think that who contributes more should also put in more effort.

I really agree with the statements you had in your comment. It was very unbelievable to see that the US owns 2100% more cars than people in Bangladesh, a gigantic disparity that one would not think of considering that many politicians usually attribute climate change to third world countries like Bangladesh rather than the US. However, it truly does make sense that countries who contribute more to climate change through carbon emissions should be doing their part to increase exposure and implementation of the Green New Deal. The US is one of the global superpowers with a high amount of influence over other countries and the ability of large scale global change. We should be taking the exorbitant amount of money going into other areas of country spending such as military costs and move it to climate relief efforts such as the Green New Deal because it is our duty to do so. In fact, the Green New Deal also very clearly explained ways to carry out solutions for climate change as you listed in your comment, which means that we have a script for the government to be following already present. The sad part is that the government and the current administration we have is simply too ignorant or blind to follow these solutions, either out of greed or genuine ignorance to the situation at hand.

The numbers and statistics that Ken presents us with are numerical measurements of our privilege that the majority of us are born with living in a first world country such as the United States. To the billions of people living in a developing country, we are living a life of unimaginable luxury, which many look up to and hold as the standard of the American Dream. However, this luxury is no doubt a product of years of heavy industrialization and overuse of fossil fuels. While we are living well and comfortably, we are dooming the rest of the world as a price.

                           <br><br>

The concept of "de-growth"  is a step to re-invent what it means to live in a first-world country for the better. Like the Green New Deal suggests, we need to stop using fossil fuels in order to prevent the many detrimental effects of the climate crisis. By doing so, America's position as a world leader and role model can influence developing countries such as Bangladesh also take a "green" route in its future towards industrialization and modernization. If the citizens of Bangladesh look up to America's high standard of life brought by environmentally friendly methods and an awareness of the consequences of our actions, we can prevent the other parts of the world from following in the same, disastrous footsteps of America. 

                           <br><br>

If America keeps on its current path, we won't be able to step up as the environmental health leader. Although the United States has the most resources and ability to do so, unfortunately, many American leaders are against adopting policies such as the Green New Deal. Unless we want to wait for someone else to take the initiative, we need political reform to solve the climate crisis.

It is quite paradoxical upon how the ones that caused the most damage will be the ones suffering the least consequences, but I guess that's where money and power could get you. To make matter worse, The Trump Administration's slogan of "America First" has undoubtedly increased the gap between us and other developing countries in terms of welfare, yet American companies are still heavily relying on sweatshops to make American products. It's sad how America is working the developing worlds into the bones and yet now is cutting it of its food and money supply to feed the rich even more. And that is just the social injustice. The environmental injustice is even worse when you realize that since the poor have no other options to receive their wage, they are forced to pollute their own ecosystem so that they could feed their children and themselves. For sure after a while, when landmass and rivers around them are polluted and unable to produce, the American companies will most likely just find a new place to establish their sweatshops in. They don't care for the people, just the profit, and that is why the world is collapsing.

I would not be surprised to see that there are plenty of objections to the Green New Deal. It is crystal clear that for any economy, a radical and complete shift from a carbon economy to a zero-emission one would seem impossible. Considering unemployment for instance, though the Green New Deal promises to establish a new industry based on clean energy, there would be an inevitable massive unemployment due to the fact that some workers would lack the necessary skills and education to get a job in the new industry. But it is glad to see that the Green New Deal, of course, took these factors into consideration. Despite a total transformation, what the new deal is offering is more like a transitional plan which could be easily implemented if the government would take it slowly and be cautious of all the possible downturns. However, one prominent question raised by the opposing party would be that such a new deal would require a massive amount of money to be successfully implemented and that becomes a great obstacle.

I wonder how exactly would the nation as well as all of its taxpayers do if the government is gonna ultimately fulfill all the terms mentioned in the Green New Deal.

We need to do more than personal actions such as switch to a plant-based diet and stop flying. We need to collectively address this global problem. Each problem has their own individual challenges to the climate crisis. As Ken mentioned in the video, our challenge is to “reel in our environmentally disastrous lifestyle.” The goal is to emit fewer greenhouse gases. The developing world faces a different set of challenges. The main challenge is to get everyone to live modern and sustainable lives without raising greenhouse gases. The answer is renewable energy sources! Ken states that the developed world needs to enter a period of regrowth while the developing world sustains responsible growth. Is this realistic? 
                           <br><br>

There is a major gap between the wealthy and poor, not only in the United States but all around the world. Bangladesh is a prime example of this. Per person, automobile ownership in the United States is 2100% than in Bangladesh. That is mind boggling, and it all stems back to systemic injustice. People in Bangladesh are forced to work under horrific conditions. The factories are located in poorer areas. It breaks my heart that the poor, people who are already struggling the most, are impacted the most. 
                           <br><br>

I think the Green New Deal is necessary. We are at risk of horrific consequences if we don’t do anything about climate change. Enough isn’t being done currently. Society needs to start adapting towards a sustainable world if we have any chance of survival.

I am from a small close-minded town where most people don’t believe in climate change. There the Green New Deal is seen as a joke and is something that will just take people’s money. I think that if people actually just read the bill then they would know that it will actually help out our economy. I think this bill is a great first step. Now we just need to get more politicians on our side who will not take money from fossil fuel companies or other big corporations. We need to educate people and let them know that they are being lied to by big corporations. People need to know everything that is going to happen to the planet.   
                           <br><br>
I liked that the Green New Deal didn’t point the blame at any other country. We are just as responsible if not more responsible for the carbon emissions in the atmosphere. We need to be one of the first to make a change in the way we live and help other countries do the same. We may not get to live the same luxurious lifestyles we live now but the future generation will have a planet that is habitable.

It really is funny that some (mostly Republican) Senators or Congresspeople make the argument that the Green New Deal, or any sort of work against climate change, is going to cost too much money in the U.S. This is illogical to me because I am aware of how money we spend on national defense and weapons manufacturing each year, something that a lot of people would consider unessential to our survival. To me, the options seem to be invest money now to shift to renewables and a sustainable future, or deal with the catastrophic effects and pay even more money to try to salvage what we can. It appears to be an easy choice, especially when you consider the idea of giving the people whose jobs will be terminated new jobs, and the training required for them, that will move us away from disaster. In the Green New Deal, there are also resolutions to make our society a more just one, since we are far from equality in terms of income, wealth, and discrimination. I admire every single person advocating for and acting in accordance with the idea of shifting to a green and equitable country/planet. Often I have to remind myself how lucky and privileged I am to be born in the U.S., and to a “middle class” family to which I am afforded a college education, a car, food daily, and even the luxury of being able to fly. Hearing the statistics comparing the U.S. per capita consumption to Bangladesh’s is startling, along with the documentary we watched a few weeks ago. I think it is selfish and foolish to cut off funding to Bangladesh when a lot of the problems the people there face probably stem from our greediness, including our food waste, participation in the fast fashion industry, and our overall contribution to climate change through atmospheric carbon dioxide output since their country is experiencing tragedy in the form of death and loss of shelter due to the changing climate and more intense weather, such as annual flooding. That being said, I think the first step to help other developing countries in their fight against injustices would be to bring mass awareness to the issues at hand. From there, people can begin to protest and advocate for their rights.

I have never considered climate injustice as a problem because those people living in poor countries get paid for sacrificing their environment. The developed world gets cheap workers, and the developing world gets jobs. It really seems like a win-win situation. However, now I understand they are not making a fair trade. This video revealed what is really going on. Poor countries like Bangladesh needs to deal with the polluted environment on their own, which is a huge budget. I just can’t imagine how would they protect their people from disasters like the Thomas Fire. Without firefighters, a wildfire would just devour everything on its way. If they encounter a massive disastrous event, they might give up solving the problem because they cannot afford it. According to Ken, they have to be more adapted for the clean energy, since they are developing countries, meaning they need to spend tons of money to make that change. Should we make the Green New deal only apply to developed countries? There are many people in this world never had a life like Americans, and I think they deserve to keep developing.

Ken takes Bangladesh as an example to illustrate social justice, environmental justice, and climate justice. Social justice or social injustice is that people in poor countries are forced to work since they are confronting chronic hunger, though the salary is very low and the working condition is very dangerous. These poor people who have to work in a factory that produces pollution and contaminates the environment of their country, which is called environmental injustice. In addition, these people who live in poor countries will suffer the consequence of the climate crisis, because they do not have money to build or buy equipment to protect themselves. However, the main contributor to the climate crisis is developed countries, so this injustice is called climate injustice. The green new deal lists lots of agreements which are to ensure the life of people in the USA, but people in other countries, especially, people in developing countries will suffer. Therefore, it is necessary to come up with a solution that can protect people around the world rather than people in a particular country. 
                              <br><br>
 Ken also notes that different countries are facing different challenges, and they need different ways to deal with them. For example, there are too many cars in the US, but only 4 out of 1000 own a car in Bangladesh compare with 838 out 1000 own cars in the US. Moreover, people in the US need to reduce their consumption of meat, but Bangladesh does not have that problem. On the contrary, many people in Bangladesh are starving. Also, developed countries need to reduce their usage of energy. In contrast, developing countries need to use more energy. Particularly, electrifying villages is necessary to reduce CO2 emissions since many villages in poor countries are burning coal to sustain their life.

In my opinion, I believe that Green New Deal is necessary and important in urging governments of the United States to take action toward issues of the climate crisis. The potential or current problems related to climate change are clearly listed, which could draw governors and peoples’ attention to the severity of climate crisis. The solutions and possible actions that governments could do to mitigate the problem are also intelligibly showed. It is evident that it is not only the issue of environment and climate but also a matter related to justice and equity, which are big concerns of American people and are supported and advocated by governments. So, the question is why are we still hesitating to make a change? I am not sure about the answer to it. Maybe people are still unconcerned about climate change, or maybe governments do not want to spend such huge money and energy to deal with it. However, I think it is important to think about it and answer it. Moreover, considering the questions that Ken brought in the end of the video that should we (or the United States) help Bangladesh as they suffer from climate change which is caused largely by developed countries, in fact, I think it is impossible because of the attitudes of government toward climate change. Additionally, it is a big deal and spend to help Bangladesh that governments maybe not willing to do it. Anyway, these are all my personal opinions and guesses.

I think each country should make laws regarding the issue of climate. Only by making rules into laws, people can follow it. If reducing the emission of CO2 is optional for many factories, I believe there won't have many factories that follow it since it is reducing their profits. In addition, I think factories should think about this issue in the long run. They only focus on the profit that they are currently earning but ignore the impact on climate. Just as the reading says, the climate crisis is causing a decrease in economic growth. If factories are continuing doing things that hurt the climate, they will get the opposite result of profiting. I agree with what Ken says, it should be a cultural change. The most important part that should be changed is the way people think. Only by changing our thoughts, we can behave in the correct way of changing the climate situation.

I like how the Green New Deal not only addresses how we can fix our environmental problems, but also how we can completely restructure the power systems of the United States. I'm always surprised by the statistics. How the US contributed to 25% of greenhouse gases, while only constituting 4% of the population; how the vast income inequality is in the United States; and I wonder, how is it possible, that in the richest country in the world, we continue to tolerate this type of injustice? I fully support the Green New Deal. But, I fear that this proposal is too much for people to accept. I know it is our only option and for that reason, I am scared that it will not go through. People do not realize how serious our problem is, how we're just encountering this problem for the first time in human history, and how we're completely out of any other option. People fear what the Green New Deal will do to the economy, but I think this is in large part due to all the fake news that is put out there and funded by conservative think tanks. People don't understand how great this is for everyone. We have the power and ability to cut down on 25% of the world's pollution, to leave the untouched fossil fuels in the ground, and to completely restructure our economy. But sadly, I don't think we will do this. People are quick to dismiss our opinions by calling us radical socialists without listening to the logic in what we have to say.

Our generation is the planet's only hope, but we have not been using our privileges to vote. It honestly saddens me how many people don't use their privilege to vote. Many of my friends are undocumented . They do not have a voice. They have no say in our government. Yet they are always affected by the policies we vote on. I see the same pattern happening with our environment. The millions of species that will go extinct have no say in the policies that get approved. The millions of people around the world who will be displaced have no say in these policies. We have the privilege in being the voice for the billions who are silenced, use it. Please. Please. Please. Vote.

It is a good news that the government is concerning the climate crisis. The Green New Deal is the proof and it shows a clean and sustainable future development. However, only showing the correct way is far not enough. We need to start implement pragmatic action. Just like Ken mentions, knowledge itself is not power. We need to use it and act in order to turn it into our power. Only showing what we should do is an empty talk. The government needs to take real actions, such as making new federal laws and implementing carbon taxes, to really change our current situation.
                              <br><br>
I agree with Ken that we should “degrowth” and start helping the developing world like Bangladeshi. The developed world has put most of the greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and they are causing climate change. The entire world is suffering from it, but some countries and people have the ability to protect them self, some do not. Because of the huge amount of burning fossil fuels, the developed worlds has grown skyrocket and we are able to withstand the impact of the climate change, but the developing worlds aren’t able to do that. Indeed, we can’t blame ourself for our fast development and the desire to live better, but it is humane and necessary to help the developing world because our actions is affecting them. After all, we all live in a same planet. If they perished from the climate crisis, I believe that soon we all will.

Im so glad this bill is actually considering every aspect on climate change and doing it in a responsible and progressive way. I appreciate the amount of facts that were used to show where we’ve gone wrong and it’s pretty cool that we’ve learned all about those aspects in this class and now we’re seeing it in a bill. The US is a great example of over consumption and over supply of commodities and goods. Their enough food for the world to eat but the allocation of food is what creates hunger issues. The US receives too much food while other countries like Bangladesh get so little of the food and only the wealthy have the luxury of receiving that food. This is a great problem that I believe we can change because we waste so much food that could have gone to other places in the first place.

Similarly to Jorge, I've found it interesting to see how the topics that we have brought to attention are current world problems or solutions. After reading Ms. Cortez' Green New Deal, my immediate reaction was, "... finally." In a world with so much wrong in it, it is difficult to find beacons of hope and even more difficult to put those beacons into practice. As a representative of the United States, Ms. Cortez is representing people like me and Jorgie. People who want change and who want to see it now. Although the bill may seem dramatic and radical, is it to my understanding, as both an educated member of society and a non-professional in this field, that change is needed and more presumptively it is needed soon. Thus, it is time to strike down on our own government before we continue to blame the world. As Jorge and Ken pointed out, it is unfair for Bangladesh, a small country that does not contribute to climate change much or at all, to bear the same weight of responsibility that we as leaders of the modern world have to take.

The Green New Deal is a great plan to help mitigate the climate crisis and offers very many realistic solutions and changes to the United State’s culture. The Green New Deal can raise the quality of life for millions of Americans and especially those in low-income areas. The Green New Deal will create more access to healthy food more people, and also cleaner forms of energy that will not have nearly as bad as an impact on the environment like burning coal and natural gases does. The Green New Deal will also help with income inequality and injustice in the United States, as well as other parts of the world. Whenever the United States does something it effects reach all across the world. If we pass the New Green Deal, the good that comes from it will be far-reaching. Being the world’s most popular country for good and bad, when we do good it has the ability to make everyone else in the world have better, healthier lives. The Green New Deal supports small family farmers which many others around the world are already doing. Especially the smaller communities that are appearing in Europe. If the US is able to make this cultural shift then everyone else in the world could easily follow in our footsteps. However, poverty around the world is going to be the biggest obstacle. Many people around the world are strictly just trying to survive each day. Many of these people have had their suffering amplified by consumerism and greed. Climate change has made more and more of the poorest people on this planet die from its effects. It is time for a global cultural change.

The US by itself has emitted 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions through 2014, and that percentage is only continuing to rise year after year. The comparison between the US and Bangladesh is absolutely absurd; it's actually quite ridiculous that third-world countries are being detrimentally affected because of larger countries such as the US, and have the challenge of utilizing more energy rather than less. 
                              <br><br>
As the Green New Deal stated, I completely agree that the US must take a leading role in reducing emissions. Like in the film "Merchants of Doubt," many representatives from other countries were angry that the US emits the most greenhouse gas emissions, yet they do not take any drastic measures whatsoever to contain them; in other words, they need to clean up the mess that they created. 
                              <br><br>
One of the main propositions that stood out to me on the Green New Deal was the implementation of high speed rail and public transits, as well as zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing. Since car usage has been a major frontrunner in releasing greenhouse gas emissions, I believe that this can significantly benefit the plane, as it discourages the use of cars and promotes the use of trains, rails, bikes, and other methods. 
                              <br><br>
Ultimately, it really is the duty of the US and the government to implement an effective deal that promotes sustainability, fight against the climate crisis, and take the lead, as too many countries are suffering along with the planet.

I completely agree with your argument that the U.S should take immediate action in order to mediate the climate crisis because the U.S owes the rest of the countries to take action as they are one of the main sources, besides Russia and the European countries, of greenhouses gases emissions that are currently destroying our planet. I think it is also important to understand that besides the U.S need of taking responsibility for their actions, they don't have a choice if they want to or not because without the support of the U.S, no matter how much third world countries reduce their greenhouse gas emission it will never be enough to relieve the climate crisis as if the U.S were also helping with the cause.


<br><hr>
I very much agree with your perspective. I couldn't believe the insanely high percentages of our meat consumption and air travel/GHG emissions compared to that of a developing country like Bangladesh. I agree with the idea that the US, as a large world power needs to be at the forefront and a leader in implementing energy conservation and GHG emissions reductions. We need to reduce our energy usage and convert what we do use to be sustainable. Not only do we need to do this because we have the ability and world influence, but also because as you said, we created a large percent of the problem in the first place. I appreciated the ideas put forth in the Green New Deal, but I wish that it said more about plans to implement the policies. I hope that our government can come together to lock into place the Green New Deal or something similar and begin implementing it, but I worry that these policies will never pass with the way our government is currently set up. In terms of relating environmental improvement in our country to helping out developing countries, I think that we need to fix ourselves before we try to fix others. I can't really believe in the idea of giving money to developing countries to help fight their climate crisis when we haven't even fixed the source of the problem. We need to redesign our energy consumption/sources, reduce GHG emissions, and become a generally green country ourselves before outsourcing to other places. That said, I do support giving money to countries facing climate crises consequences due to our actions, because it's our fault its happening to them in the first place.

I think it's insane that US has 3x as many people as Bangladesh and the numbers by which we exceed them in terms of our contributions to the climate crisis are still so high. I do agree that the United States has a moral obligation to underdeveloped countries when it comes to creating a greener future for the planet, and although the Green New Deal is more about the US, I did notice that it mentioned "promoting the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding, and services, with the aim of making the United States the international leader on climate action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal" as one of its goals. I believe this is a good thing to aim for, but I also think that everything the US does for an underdeveloped country should be done for free - without expecting anything in return. We have caused nearly irreparable damage over the course of many decades, the least we can do is prevent conditions from worsening for the helpless. Moreover, the US has to lead by example and implement laws that prevent the exploitation of poorer nations, and urge other first-world countries to do the same. A good first step would be to stop offering jobs such as working in clothing factories, and instead investing in educating the youth and the women of third world countries in order to prepare them for jobs that would benefit individuals and the planet.

Ken comparing Bangladesh, one of many underdeveloped countries around the world, to America, a first-world superpower, really put into perspective the entirely different sets of issues each nation faces currently. While America currently deals with an obesity epidemic where 40% of Americans simply consume way too much food, 40% of Bangladesh's population experiences the exact opposite, a lack of food that leads to constant hunger at minimum. Due to the climate crisis, Bangladesh experiences intense flooding periods that displace millions and kill thousands, despite not having contributed very much at all to anthropogenic climate change. Considering the big part human activity in the U.S. has played in worsening the climate crisis, I agree that America should take responsibility and aid countries impacted the most by climate change, Bangladesh being a prime example. The Green New Deal presents a framework that can put the U.S. on track to curb their climate impact, should many of the proposed changes like high-speed rail, universal access to clean water, and sustainable farming practices be implemented; I'm hopeful that from the 2020 presidential campaign will produce an administration that supports climate ventures like this and further build upon them with sound environmental legislation. I have no doubt that AOC will continue to champion and support climate policies, serving as an invigorating, young voice amidst the much older Congress members. As you said, the U.S. must set an example for the rest of the world, to show that changes that reduce the growth of climate change issues are not only feasible but effective as well. The U.S. needs to build developing countries up sustainably, not exploit them for their own personal gain as you mentioned.

As a country we produced 25% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions and as a result have played a significant role in climate change. I think we do have the responsibility to help poor developing countries in the fight against climate change since we are the ones doing the damage. These countries such as Bangladesh do not have the resources, infrastructure or money to save/protect themselves from increasing natural disasters. In the United States we do have the money and power to do so. As a world leader we should be the one leading the fight against climate change. We should be changing our power grid and doing more to decrease CO2 emissions. If we don’t because we want to continue practicing our devastating consumption habits then what does the rest of the world think? They look to us and we need to be doing more like implementing the Green New Deal.

Actually, the reading didn’t move me in the first place, but we should all feel guilty, sorry, or regretful to those people living in poor countries, like Bangladesh. They suffer in their homeland because we enjoy our lives here in more developed countries. It’s not just unfair; it betrays human rights. People in Bangladesh have no way to make their own livings, so they have to catch all the opportunities that come along. Natural resources and human capital were taken away, while all kinds of disastrous wastes are left behind. What’s more important, the poor even don’t have the ability to protect themselves. Annually, over 5000 people died and over 6 million homes were destroyed due to climate crisis. We are all murderers. How can we live enjoyable lives by leaving all the poor people in other places even cannot live safely. We are responsible to make better lives for them since we all took advantage of their raw materials and cheap labor to make our lives better. It’s time to pay back. Environmental justice, it’s a word that even ironic by its name. The proportion of people who contributed the least to the global climate crisis suffered the most throughout the severe climate crisis. Things shouldn’t happen this was, and we should make it possible in our generation, in our time.

Of course I have heard of the green new deal sponsored by AOC, but I didn’t really know what it entailed. I have heard people make comments such as “it’s too drastic” or something along the lines of it promoting socialism. After reading the Green New Deal, it doesn't seem drastic to me at all, it seems absolutely necessary. It outlines tangible steps that need to be taken in order to ensure a safe and healthy future for our planet. It gives me hope that there are people like AOC in our government who are working to help solve the climate crisis. But unfortunately, most of our government representatives do not share her same progessive beliefs when it comes to climate change (and other issues). While the Green New Deal seems like a fundamental step in the right direction, more people of power need to be supporting it. We are at a pivotal point in history regarding climate change, as it is really now or never to act. A president who believes in climate change and is dedicated to finding solutions is, in my opinion, our biggest hope for creating lasting change. Fighting climate injustice will simultaneously help fight social and environmental injustice.  Our planet does not have time to sit through another Trump administration while our world burns around us.

It really is unfortunate that many figures in seats of power do not share the same ideals or desire for change as AOC. I’ve also heard much criticism surrounding the Green New Deal - disappointingly enough, much of it has come from our generation. I felt like the document was laid out in a very clear and to-the-point method. Much of the steps listed in it do not seem at all impossible to me, but they would be very hard to achieve because of the obstacles that are governmental figures.

We have often brought up in this course that the environmental crisis is a global problem. Though we have also largely stated in the course that in the developed world, or U.S. mainly, we are exponentially making the problem worse. Now, we also talk about how we need to make cultural and individual improvements. The main thing that bothers me about all these statements is that we know of ways that we can improve our situation. "Degrowth" was a very interesting concept to bring into the course material. Take Ken's example of reducing meat consumption. This is not something that on the surface seems very difficult. However, think of how many people will actually take this lecture material seriously who are in this class alone. I personally believe that about half of this class fully divulges in the lessons that have been taught and will actually take action. Now that is only in a class of about 800 or so people. If you think about this in terms of an entire country this is still not enough. People need to seriously take into consideration the damage that the developed world and their cultural ideals are having on the planet. There will be no future for the people of this planet if the people responsibly for this problem do not start committing to solutions. We need to do better and we need to do it soon. I hope that people take the teachings that Ken has given us into extreme consideration and begin to take action.

The lack of action to compared to all of what we know that could improve our planet is frustrating! Especially living in a developed country like the U.S. where, as ken puts it in his title, "the injustice of it all" is clear and apparent. The numbers are, by all means, unbelievable. Individually, we consume more than any other country in the world. The Green New Deal is a comprehensive and detailed plan to becoming a friendlier country to our planet. To think that there are republicans in the senate that oppose this bill is ridiculous to me. The Green New Deal not only addresses climate change, but also economic inequalities which affect many Americans. This peace of legislation does more for the climate change movement than all the school walk outs and all the protests. In reading this weeks text I was reminded of the privilege we have of having our voice heard by electing people who can exercise political power to hold companies and people accountable for their environmentally harmful decisions. I think that a call for individual change is important, yes, but a demand for government change is far more important. Like you said, only half of this class will take away from Ken's lecture the advices and suggestions to live a sustainable life-style. Changing the deeply rooted ideals of a person is not easy. But the fight against climate change is a collective effort that I think demands the contemporary populism found in democracy. Because we are the change.

As I read through the Green New Deal for the first time I can honestly say that it was intelligently written in a way that goes beyond just environmental issues. I have continuously heard of this document and had a rough idea of the topics that it talked about. To my own surprise I was able to confirm the views of what I originally had about the document, but was also enlightened with how we must also change social patterns not just environmental. It was inspiring to read over the Green New Deal as it is written not to persuade, but to inform the reader of what will be done in the upcoming decades. As it holds everybody in the United States accountable to abide by what is said in the document. The fact that it draws more attention to frontline communities than most other important documents from those in power is eye opening and relieving. Their concern with these communities shows directly that they understand the negative impact that climate change lays upon these people groups and are calling for immediate change. This is by far the most significant topic I see in this entire document, but there are other good ones. As the document covers resolutions and goals moving forward as country it was to my enjoyment that it was so well detailed in what must occur, not what should occur. The beginning of the Green New Deal accurately portrayed what has already occured along with negative effects that will follow shortly. This is extremely necessary as it will open the eyes of the reader and have them intrigued early on. Once concerns are put in place the document then was able to properly state what must be done and roughly how it should be done. 
                              <br><br>


Overall the Green New Deal is a well written paper that expresses appropriate amounts of concern of the United States poor patterns, environmentally and socially. The emphasis on immediate change is depicted in an appropriate manner that is both concerning, yet inspiring. The only possible negative thought I have concerning this paper is that nothing has been done about it yet. This was written nearly a year ago and there still seems to be little progress in enforcing these standards. Although I am understanding of how soon it has been since released, I am still concerned with the fact that we do not have much left time to give unfortunately. As election season is right around the corner it is important that we keep this document in mind when voting. As it is up to us to properly appoint officials that will abide by these standards and push to enforce them more as time continues.

I like to think that humans are creatures of habit. If you do something out of the way every day, it is no longer out of the way. The out of the way actions like eating a plant-based diet, bicycling to where you need to be, turning off the water while brushing your teeth, and many other little actions all add up and become a way of life. This is the easy part for everyone mitigate climate change. 
                               <br><br>
The most effective potential mitigators of climate change are the corporations that deal with fossil fuels. Like fracking for example, pushing against this is would be the first steps to creating an incentive for humans to invest in other cleaner forms of energy.

In regards to the Green New Deal, I agree with your comment of how humans are creatures of habit. We get into this mindset that it is necessary to do things in a certain way and there are no alternative options. While switching to climate friendlier solutions such as eating a plant based diet, relying on public transportation, and reducing our intake in consumer culture, may come as an inconvenience to our daily life style, it is beneficial on a larger scale. While yes, lifestyle changes may inconvenience us, there needs to be a common understanding that the climate challenges ahead of us will only become harsher if we as a community are unwilling to change the way we live. These small changes will ultimately help us stay under the safe climate warming limit which is why it is important to make the switch to greener energy. The truth is, if we do not stick to these strategies and continue at this rate it will be not only a problem for our future generations, but a problem for us now.

It's so important to understand that climate change is an issue that's not just environmental or physical in nature. It's a huge ethical, political, and human rights issue. I feel like a lot of people that deny the urgency of the climate crisis view it through a very limited lens. They depict environmental advocates as "tree-huggers" and alarmists, and focus on environmentalism in terms of a physical environment. When it's viewed that way, it's a lot easier to choose to deny its urgency; after all, what's more important: our jobs or some trees? However, the fact of the matter is that there's so much more to it. There is an intersectionality between climate and human rights and ethics, as we really see through this video. At the end of the day, it's not just going to be about nature, it's also going to be about millions of displaced people, and billions of dollars cleaning up the messes that climate change produces, and endless injustice. The GND truly addresses this intersectionality, which is so important, but it's only ethical to go further internationally, as the GND is a very domestic plan.

I could not agree more with Ken that the developed world needs to go into a period of “degrowth”. While this term would alarm a number of people, given its negative connotations, it would actually result in immensely positive outcomes, for both developed nations as well as developing nations. Developed nations (particularly the United States) have fed off of developing nations for decades, preventing them from reaching even a fraction of the level of development that more advanced nations have achieved. How are developing nations supposed to worry about climate change when they have not even achieved food, water, shelter, or financial security? Not to mention, the vast majority of carbon emissions are coming from developed countries, while the effects of these emissions are negatively influencing developing countries the most.  The average American eats 6600% more meat than the average person in Bangladesh and the average per capita air travel is 14000% greater in the US than in Bangladesh; yet, Bangladesh is suffering far more from the effects of climate change than the US is. If this is not enough to understand the harm that developed countries cause developing countries, and incentivizing enough to help these developing countries, then I do not know what is.

It's really hard to believe that such a small group of people have had such a detrimental impact on the majority of the planet. It's even harder to believe that developed countries decided that their "needs" were more important than the actual basic needs of people in developing countries. There was absolutely no responsibility taken for the consequences of the actions that developed countries took. It almost makes me ashamed to be in a developed country, especially the United States, one of the worst bullies in the world. I obviously did not personally do these things, but we as a country did, and we as a country need to take responsibility. The least we could do is lower our carbon emissions now and transition to renewable energy, and also help developing countries enrich the lives of their people in a manner that will not harm the planet. It is so unfathomable that an industry, in this case the fossil fuel industry, is so greedy for money that they will cause the deaths of thousands, and ruin millions of lives just to turn a profit. I think the worst part is that the people suffering do not see any of the benefits that we see, and we see none of the harm that they have to endure.

I believe it. Our actions have a global impact. Developed countries like the United States have the luxury of not thinking about those in developing countries that aren't even granted basic rights. Like you, I'm ashamed of my country. At the same time, however, I feel blessed to live here. It's very confusing to me. Renewable energy is a major solution that needs to be taken more seriously.

I believe that the US should acknowledge the responsibility that we have in helping developing countries such as Bangladesh. I believe that there is a moral obligation at hand, we have the resources and capabilities in giving aid to those in need. This shouldn't be a question of whether it is the right choice, given that I have often heard the argument that it is "spoiling" the poor when they haven't put in the effort and this doesn't help them better their situation because they are just "given" resources. I find this logic to be deeply upsetting and demonstrative of the tremendous ignorance that prevails through some perspectives. I feel as though all these people in developing countries are trying their hardest within their circumstances and situations. If anything developed countries such as the US are the cause for suffering in other areas of the world. I think that the developed world has a duty to take care of those in need, instead of continuing to live in our own excess. There needs to be a greater global connection, instead of viewing the different lifestyles as a division of class. Countries such as the US have reached their peak of only enduring mostly "first world" problems at the expense of those who do not have the resources and power against injustices. We need to realize the reality of what our wealth is based on and redistribute it back to create an equal world and help the planet in tackling the climate crisis.

I quite agree with you. We all know gains come with losses. The rapid development of the United States has contributed to a lot of carbon emissions. As a result, the United States has an obligation to help developing countries avoid environmental damage. But these are all on paper. There are still many fossil fuels companies in the United States that spread false information to make money. And it is no doubt that it is difficult for them to give money to help other countries.
                               <br><br>
“Redistribute it back to create an equal world” sounds beautiful, but the key lies in the opinions of the government or even the whole US. I really wish the US can help other countries, but the process must be hard.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that we really do have a moral obligation to help out poorer countries with coping with the effects of climate change. The same ignorance and injustice that is prevalent within our society and is being fueled by Trump, is a practice that is being projected out onto our foreign relations. By working to undo Obama’s policies, Trump is lessening support for minorities in the form of welfare, medical, etc. He is trying to do the same when it comes to giving aid to poor countries like Bangladesh. As a nation in which car ownership per capita is 21,000 percent greater than Bangladesh, we are contributing way more CO2 than Bangladesh, yet they don’t have adequate resources to prepare for the consequences of climate change. To help resolve climate injustice, America needs to recognize its duty to give aid to poorer countries.



<br><hr>

I agree that developed countries have to take care of underdeveloped countries. We are one of the reasons that they are suffering so much, and nobody has the right to say that we are just giving them stuff without them putting in work. It's ridiculous that people don’t see the privilege that they have. Just by being born in America you already have so many more resources available to you than someone in a developing country. Many of these people are just struggling to stay alive, doing whatever they can to support their families. We are polluting their environments and causing many of them to have life-threatening diseases that they have to resources to treat. We are the ones killing the Earth, not them, so nobody should get upset that we are helping them recover from issues we have put upon them. Instead, we should be focusing on how we can reduce our carbon emissions, then we can focus on other people. It's hard for people in America to understand the privilege we have compared to other people because we have never experienced what it's like to live with nothing. We have such a huge moral obligation to help this person we simply cannot go any longer without doing anything. I think its also important to educate people about this issue because I didn’t know about it before watching this video.

I think that the US should be responsible for helping Bangladesh because we are the ones that damaged the earth the most. If we have the resources to be able to help then we definitely should, it’s just the right thing to do. In regards to Bangladesh and their laws I think it would be helpful to have laws in place so that they do not commit the same mistakes we did. The laws well help limit the amount of damage produced. Even if our generation (of the class) did not cause most of the damage to the earth we should do our part so that we can learn from past peoples mistakes and live in a more sustainable earth.

I completely agree that it is up to the United States, as a major contributor of greenhouse emissions, to take the lead on fixing the climate and to set an example for developing countries. After reading through the Green New Deal proposal, I understand that the worsening of the climate truly does hold more issues for the US than it might seem. Although with the country’s wealth we may be able to bypass some of the problems that accompany such a change in climate, like complete loss of infrastructure by flooding and inescapable heat, we will still be subjected to others. Some of these, which I hadn’t even thought of before, are the social and national consequences. It hadn’t occurred to me how much social unrest might accompany such a drastic change in climate, as many may take refuge in liveably undamaged countries and need resources to survive, ones that others might not want to give. This is bound to create even larger rifts in society than we already see today, making for a very unsettling social future. In regards to national security, climate change may act as a “threat multiplier,” meaning all the social and economic unrest is likely to spill over globally. It is probable that when this happens frustration will build and war is bound to happen. Therefore, with both of these other issues not directly related to the climate in mind, the United States should take the climate crisis most seriously, if not for the environment, for itself.


<br><hr>
I totally agree with your statement regarding the large responsibility the United States holds in the climate crisis. Logically speaking, we, as a nation, added the majority of the greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, so we should be the ones to fix the problem. The key in this, however, is that we must clean up the mess we made (and continue to make) for those impacted most greatly, not just us. Everyone around the globe will experience impacts of climate change, but the consequences are disproportionate.
                               <br><br>


Much of our impact on the climate has been fueled by personal interest and benefit, but the consequences have caused even greater damage for countries with the smallest climate footprints. It is essential for the United States to take action, as our climate footprints continue to grow and we cause more problems for those in less developed countries. Something like the Green New Deal is a great first step; before we help other countries, we must do something about ours. However, that doesn’t mean that we can put off helping other countries like Bangladesh until we’re perfect. It will take a long time before we’re anywhere near perfect, meaning that we must help our countries and others simultaneously. As we seemed to spearhead the damage of our climate, we must also take charge in the movement to a more sustainable global population.

I do believe that the US should help countries like Bangladesh deal with the effects of American behavior. Culturally, it is our outrageous consumer spending habits that have led to events like the Rana Plaza disaster, as companies push for the lowest production price and barely pay their workers, leading them to overwork employees in unstable environments. The Rana Plaza disaster is a product of American consumerism and the practice of fast fashion. As the documentary showed, people in Bangladesh are just trying to work, and these are the jobs they can find due to fast fashion companies hounding for the lowest price. I really feel strongly that it is awful that these multi-million corporations are paying these manufacturers just $10 a month. I don't believe anyone should have to live that way in the 21st century.

                               <br><br>

Environmentally, countries that have emitted tons of CO2 into the atmosphere should be responsible for helping with the effects. We have the resources to help, and we knowingly put all of this CO2 into the air and still refuse to stop. Without the New Green Deal, we will destroy the environment for everyone. I believe Americans need to take responsibility for their actions. Maybe that new shirt was nice, but we need to fork up the funds to fix the impact it had on the people and environment of Bangladesh. Not to even mention the farmers and the seed monopoly Monsanto has. Jeez.

                               <br><br>

As far as enacting laws in Bangladesh to try and stop the production of American goods for the developed world, I am all for it. If we're trying to cut down on environmentally unsustainable practices, which might cost people jobs, we should move production to the United States, and manufacture our products here. This will create jobs, and from what I understand about the economy (which is admittedly very little), might help lessen the blow of unemployment? I'm not entirely sure, but it would also allow Bangladesh to grow without American exploitation. And we all know that there would be an outrage in America if those big brands tried to pay American workers the same rate they did to workers in Bangladesh, which would alleviate most of fast fashion and force us to value our clothes again.

Yes, the United States has a responsibility to the developing world. The developing world is working to support the United States’ lavish spending and living habits and it has caused the rest of the world to experience just the opposite. If the United States cannot push for changes in legislation, the least it could do is use its resources to limit the effects of the climate crisis. How is it that 40% of people in the United States are obese and 10% of people in Bangladesh are starving? How is it that 18% of Bangladesh is flooding, destroying millions of homes? I agree with you, no human should be living in these conditions in the 21st century.
                               <br><br>

Events like the Rana Plaza Disaster will continue to happen if something is not done. The United States must be held accountable. How can we happily purchase a five-dollar t-shirt on sale knowing that it was made by a worker in Bangladesh that is suffering? I think establishing laws in Bangladesh could be beneficial. At some point, the line needs to be drawn. Bangladesh factory workers are working in nightmarish conditions. Passing laws in Bangladesh could be faster than passing the Green New Deal in the United States which could result in changing the way American goods are produced and consumed.

• I was also shocked by the huge difference in numbers between the United States and Bangladesh in terms of meat consumption, population size, and the number of starving people. I knew that the average American eats a lot of meat but hearing that it is 265 pounds of meat per year compared to Bangladesh’s mere4 pounds is purely astonishing. This fact is super eye opening to me because a huge number like that forces you to stop and think about your daily choices, and how choosing to adjust your eating habits can make a difference. I agree it is very unnecessary for us to be consuming so much meat, there was a time when meat was considered a luxury item, and now we treat it like a necessity to our life. I am glad we have the green new deal as an option still, like professor Hiltner said this is our best course of action right now. Even though it seems like a drastic change it will not be as difficult as it seems. 
                               <br><br>

I agree with what you said about Bangladesh Alyssa, I think enacting laws there would be very beneficial. We are the reason why Bangladesh is in the state it is now, so we should also be responsible for fixing the problem. We need to stop making the same mistakes and prevent others from making them as well. Even if our generation is not responsible for what is happening we still have a moral obligation to fix past generations mistakes. Especially if we want to see a healthy planet in our futures.

Yes ! The United States does have a duty to support countries like Bangladesh as these developing countries are suffering from the wasteful and over-consumptive lifestyle that has defined the United States' culture. It should be a given that the countries that have emitted the most CO2 into the atmosphere should be responsible for helping with the effects. Like Ken was talking about when he discussed the Thomas Fire, the United States has the resources to deal with the environmental effects of climate change, but developing countries do not. Policies like the Green New Deal are necessary to help developing countries like Bangladesh deal with these natural disasters and develop an infrastructure that is sustainable and efficient. 
                               <br><br>


I had never read the Green New Deal before and assumed it entirely focused on environmental regulations and what not. I was pleasantly surprised that there was an emphasis on social justice and the development of a new age for Americans that will involve more high-wage jobs and stronger rights for workers. Certainly the Green New Deal is something that this planet and its people need.

The actions on behalf of the Trump Administration to disregard the national and global wellbeing of our environment over the past presidential term has been truly appalling. From the corruption of the EPA by fossil fuel lobbyists appointed by President Trump, his withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, to blatant denial of global warming spread over major news and media outlets, the United States has lacked the initiative to address this crisis. This upcoming election, the mistreatment of the environment and hope for climate action is what has motivated me to become politically active with my main interest in a candidate being in regard to their climate and environmental action plan. 
                               <br><br>


I truly believe that the Green New Deal is the climate action plan we’ve been waiting for. Far too long have we seen protests calling for reform or action on the part of the United States government from advocates seeking women's’ rights, indigenous rights, labor/union rights not to mention the upsurge of climate strikes across the nation. The Green New Deal argues that the current economy and its reliance on fossil fuels and other unsustainable industries are to blame for the climate crisis. In addition, it seeks to use this opportunity to reform the economy to spread opportunity through a guarantee that the basic needs of the public (education, healthcare, etc.) will be met and a promise to expand the workforce by creating thousands of new jobs in renewable energy and sustainable industries.

This is valuable. FINALLY. We are not only thinking about who should be blamed for causing the climate crisis and why the heck he/she/they cause(s) the climate crisis. Instead, we are finally thinking about how to solve the problem, how to slow down global warming, and how to save ourselves. I personally agree with something stated in the Green New Deal. It is comparatively intact. However, since it is a ‘deal,’ a politic ‘thing,’ I am afraid that the (new) (or even the president-elected) president somewhere wants to cancel this deal someday. If so, it really becomes a political game, and the climate crisis will be harder to overcome. I really hope this will not happen. Let us work together to fight for climate justice. When people’s lives are threatened, I don’t think money is still superpower.

I agree with you entirely. I’m glad we are finally looking at possible solutions to climate change, So far we have only heard of what is causing climate change or absurd, extreme ways to fight climate change. Walden’s solution of just living out in the woods and growing your own food is just too extreme and people are not willing to make that change. By hearing that solution, it feels like climate change is a problem that can’t be solved.  In order for the Green New Deal to keep its place, we need to make sure that we elect officials in office who are supporters of fixing the global warming issue. Politics are an important factor in changing the way that the world deals with fossil fuels and the heating of the Earth. People in office have the power that will evoke people to start making a change in their daily lives. We have the capability to start dealing with this issue. The U.S. has a high technological capacity to fix climate change. Lower-income countries like Bangladesh, are suffering because higher-income countries are putting most of the CO2 in the atmosphere. In comparison to the U.S., Bangladesh contributes close to no CO2 in the atmosphere. The Green New Deal offers practical solutions to fixing this issue as fixing buildings to achieve “maximum energy efficiency, water efficiency, and safety.” Another solution was creating a more sustainable food system because food waste contributes to extra CO2 emissions being deposited in the atmosphere. We have the capability to start changing our ways before it is too late and generations after us have to live in an inhabitable planet.

<br><hr>
I agree with the idea that we should elect officials who are eco-friendly. I also recommend the minimalism’s lifestyle. We should realize that this is not the end of the world. Climate crisis can be avoided, as long as we stay positive, confident, and start action. Plant trees, save food, don’t waste stuff, we can make a difference. The importance of protecting the environment is not to save the Earth, but is to save human beings. The Earth has been fine for a really long time before first generation of human, and it will still be fine in the future. Thus, we are doing this for ourselves.

By the way, check out this week’s new video. Sad.


<br><Hr>
I completely agree with many of your points in this comment. I think that it is incredibly important that our government is finally recognizing the severity of the climate crisis, as well as coming to terms with the idea that we are one of the major contributors to this problem. I thought the Green New Deal presented in this report was very interesting because it contained lots of information about the effects we are facing due to climate change as well as provided many obtainable strategies to mitigate it. I thought it was very notable that the gender and racial wealth gap was included in this report. The inclusion of these issues conveys the idea that our climate crisis not only affects our environment. It has large effects on our social and economic development. After reading this, I find it even more laughable that people are still trying to push climate change denial. This report not only provides many concrete facts, it is published from our very own government. I think that many organizations advocating against climate change will have a harder time arguing against literature published by our very own House of Representatives.



<br><hr>
 I guess I am still worried about whether politicians will cancel the Green New Deal someday. Green New Deal cannot be canceled. It’s very important. I think there should be people who hold politicians to account so that the Deal can be protected and citizens will start to protect the environment. Also, people shouldn’t blame everything on the government or old generations anymore. Start change from ourselves. Guide everybody to take action. Be united. These are the right thing to do when facing the climate crisis. If these goals can be achieved, the climate crisis can be avoided gradually and the Earth can be more habitable.



<br><Hr>

When you noted that there needs to be people who hold politicians accountable, those people are us. Those people are the voters of America who have the power to make change. Our generation has one of the lowest voter turnouts when it comes to elections, therefore we are not voicing our opinions to elect officials into power who can make the changes our country needs. If just 50% more young people went to the polls to vote, we would make a tremendous impact. This upcoming election is a great opportunity to elect a president into office who has a strong agenda regarding our climate crisis. But even if our current President is elected to serve his second term, there are many other ways we can help mitigate the crisis politically. Local elections are almost, or more, important than the president election because the changes we vote into law directly affect us. If we want to live with more sustainable practices, we need to vote for propositions that support this. Adopting new customs at a local government level will also set the precedent for surrounding communities and larger governmental entities such as California. We often place the responsibility of creating legislation on congressmen and senators, but in reality, we play a more important role by voicing our opinions to elect the right leaders into power.


<br><hr>
 I know that our generation may have the lowest voters turnouts when it comes to elections, so our generation may not have enough power to voice. However, I really doubt that once our generation have the power to voice and vote, who will be voted. Is he/she/they still be Mr. Trump or people who are similar to Mr. Trump? If so, the situation is not going to turn around. I understand that people may think that even if Mr. Trump is elected again, there are still plenty of small changes we can may. However, I remember President Obama has said that, ‘this is the most important election.’ We cannot wait until the next election. The change has to be started now.

The US contributes 25% green house emission all over the world. It should be responsible for the rest of world, because there are some other place where do not damage environment a lot suffering the consequences of climate change. For example, there are ten thousands acres of land flooded in Bangladesh every year. And more than thirty millions people are homeless due to the flooding. But they do not own as many cars as the US. They did not emit too much carbon dioxide into the air. Why they are suffering the severe consequences of climate change? If Americans can consume less beef, less fast fashion clothes, they may suffer less pain from climate change. People should give climate justice to people in Bangladesh.

The climate crisis is a global problem but each country needs to do their own part collectively. The U.S. has to stray away from our overconsumption environmentally damaging lifestyles, where we have degrowth. In the developing world they’re focusing more on how to build a proper quality of life for everyone. The issue with each country doing their own part is that it can be difficult to keep them accountable when the proper measures aren’t in place. The Green New Deal is a resolution that talks about what America has to do for their part in contributing to the climate crisis. It is well thought out and detailed which allows great standards to be held accountable to. 
                               <br><br>

I really appreciate the Green New Deal because it discusses the intersectional issues that are occuring today. It doesn’t try to hide the impact done. It’s very straight forward in saying that climate change, pollution, and environmental destruction have exacerbated systemic racial, regional, social, environmental, and economic injustices by disproportionately affecting indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth. One of the first steps in fixing a problem is admitting the problem, and this is one of the first government formed pieces that actually admits how disadvantaged people have become. And what’s better is that it provides how we are going to protect these people during the changes that need to occur. It wants to promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth. It strives to fix the injustices among many other things. 
                               <br><br>


We need to change so much. We really need to “degrowth” as Ken mentioned in the video. We need to return back to simpler times and do so while becoming net zero emissions! We need to use this time to our advantage and change the awful systems in place. We must ensure human rights and that everyone has access to health care, affordable living, clean air and water, and economic stability, good public transportation, and access to nature that is healthy and well taken care of. The Green New Deal is not anything that can be passed, but I hope that the Democrats can win this next election to ensure that we can start practicing the Green New Deal on a political scale. I fear as though if the Republicans win this next election that we are actually going to be doomed with no time left to act upon climate change politically. They don’t do anything to help the environment or the safety of anyone in America, as we have seen in history hundreds of thousands of times. Our vote matters. If you care about the future or anything at all you have to vote for people who are putting our environment and people at the top of their priorities. Vote for people who aren’t supported by the fossil fuel industry or think tanks. Vote for people who back up the Green New Deal. You’re voting for everyone and everything on this planet, not just for you so make your vote count.

Although the developed countries of the world are mostly responsible for the climate crisis its the poorest and least developed parts of the world that are suffering the most. In order to start making progress towards change the developed world needs to work on degrowth while the undeveloped world finds ways to grow sustainably. Bangladesh is an impoverished country that is the site of many factories used for producing first world consumer products. The workers of these factories however face dangerous working conditions and extremely low wages because they have no other options for work. These factories pollute the surrounding communities and water sources further depleting the standard of living for those living around the factories. There is an extreme wealth gap in the world that allows the well off to fend off the effects of climate change while leaving the poorest and most impacted to suffer. The Green New Deal seems like an impressive and impactful piece of legislation that could really turn the course of climate change and America’s role in the escalation of the problem. Since its American run factories damaging the lives and economies of poor countries like Bangladesh, it's also our responsibility to make sure there are strong environmental, health, and safety laws implemented.

First world countries are very materialistic causing their carbon footprint to be higher than third world countries. Third world countries don’t really know all the “nice” things that we have and they don’t have the money to buy what first world countries have. Because of this third world country's carbon footprint is really low. I think that it is sad that the reason third world countries are being affected is because of the cravings for luxury that first world countries have. I also agree that we should make sure that poor countries have the resources that they need in order to succeed. We should make sure that we are helping other countries and not harming them. Since we are polluting other’s food and water, causing health risks for them, we should implement laws that will not harm the people that we take land from, that is the least that we could do. The Green New Deal shouldn’t be a “thing” only in the United States, I think that it should be in other countries, it should be taken up to the united nations and debated amongst all countries and not just our country.

The US is definitely responsible for helping not only Bangladesh, but all 3rd world countries that will suffer because of our mistakes. We greatly profit off of the people in developing countries, and while the US gets richer and consumers get more things, the workers grow poorer and put their lives at risk every day to make clothing to our capitalist society. People rave about our great country, so lets show the world why we are the best country and we must right our wrongs by investing in ourselves and in other countries to fight the climate crisis. It is a problem that we created, and so we must place laws in place to fix it, and the green new deal is our savior.

Created by the AOC, the green new deal is the solution the US (and thus the world) needs to stop and further prevent the crisis from spreading. I very much enjoyed this reading because I knew the gist of the green new deal and I knew I supported it, but now I know exactly what it outlines and I even more so support its propositions. Not only will the deal create new jobs, stimulate economic growth, and protect marginalized communities, but through our initiatives we will serve as the example and become the leader of saving the planet, which will inspire other countries to do the same.

I completely agree with your comment. I also knew of the Green New Deal and its goals, but actually being able to read it was very enjoyable and I feel more informed now I have read the bill itself. I completely am for the Green New Deal as I liked how it acknowledged that the US is one of the biggest contributors to the climate crisis so it is our responsibility to be the international leader on fighting climate change and promoting those practices to the rest of the world. Right now we are the last place anyone in the world should look to as an example for how we should be acting, but if we followed the Green New Deal we could be. The practices outlined in the bill made me hopeful of the society we could be as we could use our insane amount of power, wealth, and leverage for good. We could be the example for not only environmental standards but also economic inequality and making sure we have decent living standards for all people. We need to have a moral economy, one that takes people and the environment into consideration. The bill was very inclusive through its social justice aspects of respecting indigenous people and people of color and poor people. They are the first to be affected by the decisions made, such as the Dakota Access Pipelines. The bill actually addresses these issues and sets the playbook for how we should be as a society. Climate change and social justice and the economy are all so closely interconnected and this bill envelopes it all. We are far from being the best country in the world like we boast we are, but we could be. And the Green New Deal is the place to start that.


<br><hr>
I think it's important for everyone to read the Green New Deal. As I said before I knew I supported it, but I hadn't even read it! Imagine if all its opposers actually took the time to read it (and it's very short so there is no excuse not to). We like to call ourselves the leader of the free world, so lets start acting like it. I agree that as of now, we are not setting the example we should be, but like you said if we pass the Green New Deal we can become the country the world needs us to become. Let's take responsibility for our actions and lead the way to repairing this planet. We should be proud to pave the way for other countries to also help the climate crisis. We've never had an economy that takes people and the environment into consideration, and that is impossible because of capitalism. But perhaps with the Green New Deal that can change. The climate crisis is an interdisciplinary problem, and I love how the Green New Deal acknowledges and addresses that. Your last statement is perfectly said, we can be the best country in the world, and we can start with the Green New Deal.

The data about the comparison of air travel between united states and Bangladesh made me speechless. 14,000 percent is not a slight number in any point of view. I do know that Americans make lots of air trips but I am still impressed by the number which is showed. I can feel about the word fairness in this particular case. The pollution caused by Americans is taking the karma on people in Bangladesh, which gives an idea about climate justice. When the rich makes the environmental problems, the poor is going to undergo the punishment from the nature like flooding. The biggest carbon emission country, as the united states, can stop the fire with plenty of money, how about those poor countries? They do little about the greenhouse gas but they need to solve the climate problems more urgent than developed countries. Injustice comes from here.

I agree. It is very inconsiderate on America’s part to knowingly emit the greenhouse gases that are directly harming the poorer countries like Bangladesh. Until we get our government to abide by the New Green Deal, all we can do is play our part and reduce our carbon footprints as much as possible. As long as we stay conscious of doing this, and vote in favor of our environment when the time comes , change will occur for the better. It is a shame our government does not want to acknowledge the harm being done in poorer countries that is largely caused by us Americans. The fact that people in Bangladesh only have 8 cars in every 1000 is absurd to our statistic, which is almost 900 in 1000... change will come in time but we must take action now as many people are already doing. A huge portion of this relies on our government’s choice to accept the Green New Deal. Ken brought up a great question in his video regarding whether or not we should help those caught in disaster and the answer is yes, we must.

Ken introduces the lecture by bringing out a critical point that the developed countries should exploit less energy while the developing regions should use more energy to maintain a sustainable growth. It’s upset to me to see the comparison of figures between US and Bangladesh in terms of car ownership, flights taken and meat consumption. We are all human beings and it makes no point that while some people are suffering to satisfy basic needs, others are constantly consuming and exploiting limited resources. Overall, we share the same planet, if some disasters like what is portrayed by the movie 2012 truly take place, none of us can survive. As far as I’m concerned, countries like US and Russia should take the leading role of assisting other developing countries, despite US has contributed to one-fifth of the greenhouse gas emission. Besides, there needs to be a cultural change regarding the consumerism attitude inside the Americans. I once was talking with my friends during Black Friday purchases that there should be anti-shopping-shopping-club or at least reducing unnecessary purchases, so that catastrophes like Rana Plaza in Bangladesh will largely decrease.

Hi Vicky, I agree with you. It also saddens me to think about how much US consumption exceeds that of other places such as Bangladesh. It is really sad to see how much other places suffer due to the actions they didn't even emit themselves. To answer Ken's question, I do think the US should take charge and help out Bangladesh. It is unfair to just ignore and not help out when the US has contributed (as you mentioned) one fifth of the greenhouse gases.

People in America eat 6600% more meat than Bangladesh, and we have an obesity epidemic.  Its crazy to think that so many people are starving in the world, while in america people are eating so much food that they can't even walk normally. This is horrible and a dishonor to mankind. Not only is this the case but air travel is 14,000% higher than in Bangladesh. This just shows how America really has a huge problem that is systemic to the overall culture in America. While Ken was comparing America and Bangladesh I felt sick to the stomach regarding how horrible of an impact America is having on the environment.

This lecture does a very good job of organizing the different issues and types of climate activism. America and other countries have countries such as Bangleshesh in a horrible position. This position is where they are in such poverty that they have to accept our jobs that we outsource to them. In turn they also get the worst end of the effects of climate change. We use them for our stuff then ruin their environment in the same day.

I have to agree with you Zachary Brumm, knowing that the US eats 6600% more meat than Bangladesh, while there are people who are starving in Bangladesh, seems very inhumane. I already knew how the US is exploiting developing countries since I saw "The True Cost"  and it is sickening. It sucks to know that we are the country who puts 25% of carbon emissions in the atmosphere but we have the money and technology to fight any consequence of that. I hate to imagine if any developing country had a huge wildfire and that they can not do anything about. All they can do is escape and hopefully make it.  This is so unfair and we need to put an end to this and one thing that can help is the Green New Deal. We need to vote for someone who supports the Green New Deal regardless if there are a democrat or republican. I bet you if I showed anyone the Green New Deal they would advocate it. The Green New Deal should not be political at all but unfortunately it is.  Hopefully we can propose a deal where we are socially, environmentally, and climatically aware of other countries. These developing countries deserve justice.

I personally have a lot of faith in the green new deal and not just because many powerful, influential politicians are backing it, but because it actually sets out to not only better our whole country environmentally but socially as well. I think that’s where the real problems are rooted. The rich can buy their way out of climate change for as long as they have substantial funds, but the rest of the world will suffer because of the rich’s doing. The example that Ken used which involved Bangladesh and the horrific jobs they have to work sickened me. Not only do they have to take low paying, dangerous jobs but they will also have to deal with some of the first climate change related disasters such as increasing flooding. Not only are people in other countries suffering because of the worsening climate but people right here in the U.S are feeling the effects. In order to fix how the U.S deals with its environmental issues such as droughts, flooding, longer hurricane seasons, and even longer fire seasons, we need an all inclusive plan and the Green New Deal looks like it’s the saving grace. Although it doesn’t include how we are going to make these changes it is a starting point and it’s a pretty good one.

I think that the Green New Deal has great potential to be implemented because it enacts equality. It covers many grounds, acknowledging the damage that it could do to low income populations, people of color, etc. Not only does it attempt to reverse our climate footprint, but the people that it tries to protect are those usually with little protection. 
                               <br><br>
However, many people are letting their opinion of the Green New Deal get swayed by politicians and other media. What would happen if people were to read it themselves, without any political introduction? How would the majority of people see this idea? The document isn't very difficult to understand as a whole, and I believe that many people would be on board if they took the time to educate themselves on the larger issue of the global climate crisis. We educate ourselves on politicians and prevalent issues in our country because they directly affect us. The irony is that WE created this problem and we are just now seeing the damage that it may have. The damage extends globally, and we've caused 25% of the destruction to occur. Because of this idea, I believe that we should have to pay for it. We can afford it, and it will create jobs. The Green New Deal is a look into the future where we can try to fix the past and manage what's to come with more control.

The Green New Deal is a revolutionary resolution that is necessary to combat climate change and the ramifications attributable to climate change. At just 14 pages, The Green New Deal is short, concise and easy to read. Moreover, it is well organized. It begins by outlining the future impacts of climate change if no action is taken, thus showing the reader the urgency of this resolution. The Green New Deal then proceeds to discuss the United State's responsibility to deal with the impacts of climate change as well as current challenges within the US. Then the resolution goes into the benefits and goals of the Green New Deal and finally ends with a plan of action moving forward. The format and organization allow ordinary people to comprehend the Green New Deal and understand what it entails. Unfortunately, many critics of the Green New Deal have not taken the small amount of time to actually read the resolution and just believe that it will increase taxes. However, the Green New Deal was intentionally written to be vague and appeal to the interests of a diverse group of Americans. For example, it discussed jobs, the economy, social justice, the environment, national security, and other topics. 

                               <br><br>

The Green New Deal is an important step in our fight against climate change. I believe that the United States bears responsibility for many of the impacts of climate change and as a result, has an ethical obligation to take action. The United States is responsible for 25% of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, yet the US does not primarily experience the impacts of these greenhouse gases. Instead, the impacts attributable to climate change are disproportionately experienced by developing countries. Therefore, the United States must help these developing countries through knowledge and technology exchange, investment in renewable infrastructure, loans and funding, and other actions.

Couldn’t agree with you more Rachel. It’s a short simple resolution that presents its ideas and propositions without making things too complicated. Before this, I had never read the actual resolution, and instead had only learned about snippets of it, so I never really understood what people meant when they would claim it was too vague. Now  it makes sense. But I don’t think it being vague is a bad thing. Since it isn’t actual legislation, but instead just a resolution introducing the idea, it’s a good thing that it is simple and concise. It allows ordinary people, instead of only scientists, to understand what they’re reading. Not only that, but it also allows people to view it with the least amount of negativity. Its simplicity shows that it’s harder to argue against something with so little substance, a mere outline, as opposed to something more detailed. 
                               <br><br>

The Green New Deal is an important and necessary first step when it comes to fighting climate change. As you mentioned, the United States needs to take responsibility for the majority of this crisis, and in turn take action. We’re responsible for a huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions, yet feel the least amount of side effects. The US has the funds to provide disaster relief, but other countries can’t afford such luxury. The countries that contribute the least, such as Bangladesh as Ken mentioned, are experiencing horrible consequences. And they don’t have the means to do anything about it. But the US does. We have the financial ability to provide relief to these countries, but what I think would be even more important than that is actually cutting to the source of the problem and creating lasting change.The Green New Deal is the first step to doing so and is absolutely necessary.

I do strictly believe national powers like the U.S, Europe and Russia should pay for their ramifications.  Unstable infrastructure in countries like Bangladesh is a byproduct of the consumerist society in first world countries. It is heartbreaking to find out through this video of the disasters that have occurred in third world countries that have barely any public coverage. The statistics comparing  America beef consumption as opposed to Bangladesh is very alarming. The Green New Deal is a very respectable approach toward fighting both social/climate injustice. If we are able to have zero net emissions by 2050  by ending all forms of social oppression, we will be able to revert climate change. If the United States enters as a leading force willing to completely reindustrialize their fossil fuel and economic society, we truly have an opportunity. However, because of this, I think it is of extreme importance for the United States to take the first step in order to encourage other nations to support the cause.

I completely agree with your view on how the national powers are responsible and should pay for their ramifications. With the US producing 25% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions alone, we have greatly impacted the planet. The statistics regarding America's beef consumption compared to Bangladesh is why America is known for hamburgers and being obese. After reading The Green New Deal, I agree with the points of how to combat climate change, and it is an approach that brings hope to our planet. If all these world leaders took the approach to solve climate change, I believe we can make a big difference.


<br><hr>
I agree that countries like the US should have a responsibility to help out the countries that suffer as a result of our imperialism or the effects of our outsourcing since we are placing them in these positions. Our contributions outweigh those of the less developed countries to an extent that even the countries we never touch have to suffer the consequences of our emissions. If we can set a precedent with something like the Green New Deal which will put us on a corrective track that will hopefully be able to mitigate the crisis we face, then other world superpowers are going to be forced to follow suit. If we can cut down these emissions effectively on a global scale then our collective efforts will be enough to save us from ourselves.




<br><hr>
I too agree that the large developed countries like the U.S., Europe, and Russia should be held accountable for their actions and support these countries as they are destroyed by the effects of climate change. Like Ken points out and you stated the damages to these developing countries are a direct result of us overindulging in every aspect of our lives. From the point source pollution of the factories supplying our goods to the ever-rising temperatures from a majority of the greenhouse gases put out by the developed world, as a country, we should be embarrassed. Primarily for the reason that most of the developing world has no choice but to help supply our overindulging to try and grow or sustain their countries. Additionally,  the current administration has even cut international aid significantly to these developing countries worsening the effects of climate change from lack of aid while we still source large factory work from these countries. While I feel the Green New Deal is a large step in the right direction I also feel it doesn't do enough since it's just recommendations of the steps we should take in the right direction. It does a great job of explaining the key steps that will be needed to be taken to begin to mitigate climate change but excluded things like waste less food or reduce beef and dairy production which are equally if not more important than some of the steps proposed. Additionally, if the current administration was supportive of the Green New Deal it would be a lot more effective because they'd see the importance and urgency to reach these goals and steps proposed in the Green New Deal. Sadly, until the administration is replaced, the Green New Deal I feel won't help accomplish much besides spreading the correct ideology of fixing rather than pushing off the effects climate change is having.

I also agree on how our country should be held more responsible for its actions against earth's climate. We have such a larger impact than other countries that it only makes sense to be forced to make changes. I think that also while the US should work to fix other parts of the world, we should also focus on fixing our own country as well. Without changing our own infrastructure, i don't see it possible to help others. I think the Green New Deal's approach will greatly aid our country and our world in fixing the  climate we live in.

The Green New Deal is something that many citizens and politicians should be taking more seriously. Our planet Earth, the home to every single one of us and every species that has lived before us and will after us, is quickly dying because of human impact. The United States, in particular, is responsible for a huge fraction of carbon emissions that are essentially leading to drastic climate change. It is very important, yet very disappointing, realizing that people living in extreme poverty are the ones with the least carbon footprint but also the ones experiencing climate change first hand. They are the ones who are being the most affected by climate change that first world countries are essentially enabling. The Green New Deal is vital in slowing down climate change here in the US and essentially the entire world. It’s very upsetting that proposals like the Green New Deal are being ignored by many first-world citizens while people like those living in Bangladesh are experiencing extreme flooding, essentially destroying millions of homes and killing thousands. It is time we step up to the plate and acknowledge our faults. We must take responsibility for the harm we are inducing into our planet Earth and those who inhabit it.

I agree with you that people should face the environmental issue directly and treat the climate change more seriously. Because everyone on the Earth will be deeply affected if the pollution and climate change keep getting worse. No one can live on a inhabitable planet. It is challenging for developed countries because it means that the whole country will need to rely on renewable energy which is much less than what we are currently using. But people have to realize that we all need to make some changes to protect our planet.

The comparisons that Ken provided for us between the United States and Bangladesh are truly shocking. I was already aware that a great percentage of the damage we have been doing to our earth is caused by the United States, and the underdeveloped world has been suffering a lot more from the damage we have caused although they are a small percentage of the problem. This is just a mere fact that I believe everyone already knows or at least should know. But when Ken started to provide statistics such as Bangladesh meat consumption is only 4 pounds per year versus the United States consuming 265 pounds per year was really eye opening. Just goes to show how selfish we Americans are. The amount of meat we consume is very unnecessary and to point out, a lot of our food goes to waste too! We could be out here helping other countries who are out there starving - specifically the 40 million people across Bangladesh who suffer from starvation. They don't only suffer from starvation but thousands of them are dying every year due to mass flooding; over 5,000 of them are killed every year and more than 6million homes are destroyed. When Ken pointed this out, it completely devastated me because it is our fault - the fault of the United States. We should be taking responsibility for our damaging actions and helping out the rest of the world so they don't have to suffer from what we have done.

The United States needs to take more responsibility when it comes to the effects it has on foreign countries. As you said we cause a large percent of global damage for only taking up a small percentage of the total worlds population. We need to hold ourselves accountable for our actions because honestly no one else will do it for us. I found the fact that the average person from Bangladesh eat only 2% of the amount of beef that the average american consumes absolutely astounding. You stated that this goes to show how selfish Americans. I partially disagree with you however, because to people who are educated on the issue this is very apparent that the United States problem with consumption is immensely selfish. However I don't believe this issue is cause by American selfishness, rather American ignorance is the true intent of our consumption problem. What I mean by this is that most people don't understand the global consequences of their actions. This is a result of these consequences not being publicized, and are not given the proper attention that they deserve. I think a key action Americans should take is to better educate themselves on what their actions lead to and upon realization of that hopefully many people will change their actions.

I was also aware of the fact that the United States was responsible for a large percentage of greenhouse gas emissions but was shocked when I heard the statistics regarding Bangladesh. It is honestly not fair that underdeveloped parts of the world are suffering due to American actions. It shows that Americans only care about themselves and this needs to change. I think a lot of people in the United States don’t realize how large of an effect our actions have on other parts of the world. For example, I was not aware that meat consumption in Bangladesh was only 4 pounds per year, whereas the United States consumed more than 265 pounds per year. If more people in the United States were aware of the damages we are causing to other parts of the world, I think it would be easier to help these other countries and fix our own lifestyles. I found the Green New Deal reading very interesting as well and actually enjoyed it. I liked how it laid out all the reasons we are emitting a high percentage of greenhouse gases and how we can fix this. There is no reason for the United States to not fix their own actions because we are already experiencing damage from climate change. For example, the US is experiencing shorter life expectancy, a large racial wealth divide, a gender earnings gap, and the top 1 percent of earners accruing 91 percent of gains in the first few years of economic recovery after the Great Recession. We are also experiencing the threat to our national security. The Green New Deal offers a solution however. This solution can be accomplished through a 10 year plan. This solution requires us to build resilience against climate change related disasters, repair and upgrade the US infrastructure, and overhauling transportations systems in the US. Reading this article really showed me that we have solutions to fix the issue of rising climate change. While it seems impossible to do so, we can slowly start changing our own lifestyles and help underdeveloped countries that are ultimately suffering due to our actions.

I agree with the following comment and also found that the comparison between the United States and Bangladesh was truly shocking. Ken mentioned that 40 million people across Bangladesh are suffering from starvation. This specifically stood out to me and made me immediately feel angry with myself that I was not aware of this and am apart of the United Staes who is consuming 265 pounds of meat per year oblivious of the starving countries across the world such as Bangladesh. I think it is important to implement the Green New Deal because as it mainly focuses on the U.S. economy, which makes sense because we are the ones that put the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere so we are the ones that should be changing the most in order to help and make an impactful change across the world. The Green New Deal ultimately explains how human activity is the main cause of the climate crisis and offers changes that the deal would call for and the benefits of them if implemented. I agree that human activity is the main cause of the climate crisis. At the beginning of the Green New Deal, I thought it was smart that it stated some statistical information that explains what our world may come to if we continue at the rate we currently are at. One statistic that stood out to me was, “a risk of damage to $1,000,000,000,000 of public infrastructure and coastal estate in the United States.” When reading information such as the following, it makes me realize that it really is our fault, the fault of the United States for a large portion of the climate crisis, which is why we must help change the world and help all the people suffering due to our actions.

I too felt pretty angry with myself for the same reason you do. I am also part of the population who consumes 265 pounds of meat per year which is very shameful to say considering all that we have been learning over the past 7 weeks about how terrible meat is not only for our health but the health of our environment. But I am also proud to say that I have significantly reduced the amount of meat I have been consuming by a long shot. I used to eat meat on an everyday basis throughout my entire life, I couldn't go a meal without some sort of meat/poultry on my plate. However, over the past couple of months I've changed my diet significantly. No, I have yet to take on a full plant based diet, but I probably consume some sort of meat maybe once a week and it's usually always chicken, hardly beef, which is a big change for me. I am glad that you are now aware that you're part of the population who consumes 265 pounds of beef per year and the harm that it has on our country and others. Hopefully you can benefit from this and change your diet to help reduce your carbon footprint - even if it's not going full plant based, but consuming less meat (like me) is better than doing nothing in my opinion. The little changes do matter!

Hello Hailey! You've made some really good points. I agree with you, I don't think many Americans are aware that the damages we cause have an effect on other countries too. This is why we need a change in our education system, starting at an early age such as elementary school. Kids should be taught about the climate crisis, obviously in a simple way in which they can comprehend it, and continue to take courses each year as they grow so they can comprehend it even more and go into depth with it. This way they can be educated on the topic, and how our personal life choices can be very damaging, having a deep effect on our planet. Throughout my K-12 grade years, I was never once taught about climate change. I of course knew about it through my own personal research, watching videos/documentaries, reading articles, and my mom would educate me on a few things, but my school district never offered classes on it. I know if they were to offer classes on climate change it would have not only benefited me but the thousands of other kids in my district. A lot of these kids (or grown ups now) are probably still unaware of this issue and how our personal choices are detrimental to poorer countries - this is why we continue to see damaging effects. A change needs to start happening now!

It is really astonishing to have these horrible statistics comparing the US and Bangladesh. It is literally every aspect of life that reflects the huge disparity, and these aspects range from daily supplies and transportation. Based on these facts, it becomes more important to clearly classify social justice, environmental justice, and climate justice and solve the problems that correspond to each classification to reach the most efficient approach. 
                               <br><br>


I think it’s a good start that through education on this climate issue, I have a clearer knowledge of the overall picture. Compare to the general knowledge that climate change has bad impacts, the justice issue in three perspectives weighs more at this moment. And it’s also efficient to differentiate the solutions to first world countries and developing countries.

I absolutely agree with the concept of "degrowth" being a necessity for our culture. This idea aligns with minimalism in my mind as well, and really does aid in clarifying that there isn't much room for change in the realm of adding more to our society. An overall reduction in human activity would clearly benefit the environment, however as we have seen it does not do anything for human standard of living or economic comfort. The green new deal addresses climate crisis issues in an all encompassing and humanitarian way. Every goal is supported with mechanisms to ensure quality of life is improved as well. If the future of our government really does follow this path, I look forward to the future. This is how government should be: acting to serve and protect its people and their landscape. The climate crisis is a more approachable issue as well when presented in the strategic and interconnected way as a set of goal to benefit the rest of America's issues as well. These ideas provide a compromise to younger environmental activists and older generations concerned about America's well-being.

Regarding Bangladesh, I don't think America necessarily needs to be concerned yet. I don't think that it is the job of our country to correct their socio-economic issues or help them figure out their own politics, however I would hope that my country would do everything in their power to not make any issues worse for them either, especially if they're providing our country with goods and services. The reality of it is, in wealthy California there is absolutely no taste of how bad things are. I can't imagine being hungry or uneducated. It is my natural right to learn and make my own choices, and I do not think it will ever be made entirely clear to me how privileged I am. And while a lot of America is in this same position, it is incomprehensible to think of how bad the quality of life may be for some of my fellow citizens. The worst conditions in other countries will be publicized to create an impression, but similar situations can be happening the next city over and our lives are just too busy to know better. I believe that, as long as we are not harming other countries, ours needs to prioritize its own people first before helping those of others.

    While I agree on the first part of your point, I slightly disagree with your second point. As you and ken noticed, we need to enter in a period of degrowth to work out on our personal relationships to better reduce population growth and create an economy based on reducing carbon footprint. Our challenge? to significantly reduce as much energy as we can to achieve our goals. In contrast, developing countries are handled the task to use more energy but in a sustainable manner. This means that both developing and developed countries need to work together to achieve each other's goals. The developed countries should learn from developing countries and vice versa.
                               <br><br>
In regards with your second point a slightly disagree with it. I know that the U.S. should not intervene in other countries' affairs as we know the U.S. has caused many troubles in the past by doing so. Ken used Bangladesh as an example so I just going to use it too. I believe that countries such as Bangladesh where we exploit their workers, pollute their lands, and overall make their quality of life worse, should be helped by those same countries who choose to do such terrible things. Actually, I think developed countries should stop contaminating others' lands, and instead contaminate their own land (not necessarily the best approach) or they should apply policies to increase social justice, environmental justice and climate justice. We cannot just go to a poor, needy country to set new industries and further exploit the way they live for our own benefits. They are human beings just as us that should have the same rights and privileges. I am not saying that the U.S. should intervene in Bangladesh's politics or economic lives, but they sure have the responsibility of proving workers who are employed by American industries to live a better life. Not to be treated as animals and objects that can easily be replaced when "one fails." This is more a moral responsibility that the U.S. needs to come into terms with. We need to avoid more incidents like Rana Plaza and care more about people's lives over desired projects.

I have finally understood what the Green New Deal is. Before, I only had a small notion of what truly meant as many news broadcasts would NEVER talk about its importance. However, thanks to Ken, now I know more about this resolution which I am further going to comment in the other video about the Green New Deal. Overall, I believe you made a good argument, especially with the connection you made regarding our neighboring cities being in the same state as those poor countries. We should work on ourselves first before helping other countries. We cannot be hypocrites, but rather environmental activists that bring hope to others. We need to be the beacon of light for a rather gloomy and dark future if we don't change the way we live.

My thinking process is the same as yours. The same concepts of human interactions - if you cause a problem, it should be your priority to fix it - should be applied to foreign relations as well. It sounded slightly ignorant when Bella stated how we should focus on our people first. If you think about it, the people of Bangladesh can be considered our people as well since companies set up shop in their country, and exploit them in THEIR OWN country. I believe it is possible to resolve the issues we caused in foreign places, while also focusing on our own problems.
<br><hr>
I agree with you, I believe there are indeed ways of helping countries like Bangladesh with at least their most basic needs without hurting our own. At the same time I don't believe U.S. has the sole responsibility on helping countries affected by climate changes, despite that U.S. might have been contributed to a big portions of it. Climate changes are still a global issues- strictly saying all of us have more or less, contributed to climate changes due to our lifestyles etc. There is not really an absolute fair way on determining who is responsible for that, and I am against putting obligations on a single country and say "they should do something to fix what they did wrong", but I would rather suggest everyone of us to think if we have ways, within our own abilities, to help people who are suffering from floods, starvation, losing homes because of climate changes. A more important thing is how we NEED to change our lifestyle to delay and stop climate changes, on top of that it would be great U.S. decide to help, while still prioritizing U.S. citizens.

Reading “The Green New Deal” made me realize how this country focuses on the present and fails to plan for the future. The U.S. has one of the largest economies and fails to realize that this can come to an end if we don’t work on sustainability. The paper mentions that “Global warming at or above 2 degrees celsius will cause... more than $500,000,000,000 in lost economic output by 2100.”  We are responsible for 20% of the greenhouse gasses emitted and ignore the fact that this is not only going to affect us but other countries as well. I agree with the propositions this paper has as it not only focuses on how the climate crisis will affect one particular community in the U.S. but the country as a whole. We as a country need to make cultural changes in order to help our planet.
                                <br><br>
I agree with your first statement as I also believe degrowth is necessary in order for our country to contribute to change. Like you mentioned unfortunately, our country at the moment does not see the climate crisis as a priority and therefore is not interested in investing a large sum of money in making the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy but hopefully in the future things change and propositions like the green new deal are accepted. Although I agree with your first point, I disagree with your second point, in regards to providing countries like Bangladesh aid. The U.S. is responsible for a great amount of the greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere and like Ken mentioned, although both developed and undeveloped countries are suffering from natural disasters caused by climate change we have the money to rebuild this is a privilege other countries do not have. I believe that in the same way that we exploit and contaminate these countries to provide us with materialistic WANTS, we should provide them with their basic human NEEDS after a disaster has occured.
<br><hr>

I am just curious as to when you believe the U.S. should be concerned about Bangladesh. It seems that conditions are already extreme given the Rana Plaza accident that killed thousands of female workers. Mind you, those workers were in the building because of U.S. corporations outsourcing labor and factories, putting workers in slave like conditions. The country is also sinking, and this will displace people in the millions. Also, in comparison to the rest of the world, someone living in the U.S. is much richer than citizens in the developing world. 1 out of 4 people in Bangladesh live in hunger. Please do not separate yourself from this injustice. Just because you don't see it happening, doesn't mean we should just ignore it. I also believe it is a bit ethnocentric to put America first. Are human lives not equal in value because one lives on another side of the world?
